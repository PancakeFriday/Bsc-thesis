  Abstract                 = {Abstract We study Borromean 2n-halo nuclei using effective field theory. We compute the universal scaling function that relates the mean-square matter radius of the 2n halo to dimensionless ratios of two- and three-body energies. We use the experimental value of the rms matter radius of 22C measured by Tanaka et al. (2010) [3] to put constraints on its 2n separation energy and the 20C–n virtual energy. We also explore the consequences of these constraints for the existence of excited Efimov states in this nucleus. We find that, for 22C to have an rms matter radius within 1 – σ of the experimental value, the two-neutron separation energy of 22C needs to be below 100 keV. Consequently, this three-body halo system can have an excited Efimov state only if the 20C–n system has a resonance within 1 keV of the scattering threshold. },

Our primary goal is to transfer quantum degenerate Feshbach molecules into the absolute ground state via the stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP). We have achieved a dual-species BoseÃ¢â‚¬â€œEinstein condensate of 41 K and 87 Rb in a magnetic trap, which consists of N K =1.4Ãƒâ€”10 4 potassium atoms and N Rb =3.5Ãƒâ€”10 4 rubidium atoms. An optimum optical transition for STIRAP is being identified by a separate experiment based on photoassociation in a dual-species magneto-optical trap of 41 K and 87 Rb.},

  Abstract                 = { In this article we present a theoretical model for the lightâ€“matter interaction of a two-level atom and a femtosecond laser pulse, spectrally cut in the vicinity of the atomic resonance. The model utilizes a transformation into an interaction picture from a bare atomic state basis and is applicable to two-level systems. This transformation simplifies some of the dynamics of the interaction. A complementary intuitive picture is also presented and describes the interaction of the induced dipole with the pulse's transients. The calculations are in excellent agreement with experimental measurements performed on an ultracold rubidium gas. },

Specifically, we have fitted an analytic functional form to line positions of the high-resolution Fourier transform spectrum of RbCs obtained by a laser-induced fluorescence technique. The results for the ground electronic state of RbCs show that the present method provides an efficient way to obtain diatomic potentials with great accuracy.},

  Abstract                 = {We prove rigorously that the number of bound states of a three-body system grows according to the formula N ∼ 1/π ln(|a|/R) when the ratio of scattering lengths, α, to the range, R, of two-body forces is large, in agreement with Efimov's recent claim. We discuss the meaning of this effect in terms of the behavior of the Faddeev equations describing the three-particle system, and clarify several points of Efimov's paper. },

The condensate fraction first appeared near a temperature of 170 nanokelvin and a number density of 2.5 x 1012 per cubic centimeter and could be preserved for more than 15 seconds. Three primary signatures of Bose-Einstein condensation were seen. (i) On top of a broad thermal velocity distribution, a narrow peak appeared that was centered at zero velocity. (ii) The fraction of the atoms that were in this low-velocity peak increased abruptly as the sample temperature was lowered. (iii) The peak exhibited a nonthermal, anisotropic velocity distribution expected of the minimum-energy quantum state of the magnetic trap in contrast to the isotropic, thermal velocity distribution observed in the broad uncondensed fraction.},

  Abstract                 = {Publisher Summary This chapter describes the coherent population trapping in laser spectroscopy. Coherent population trapping may be also described as the pumping of the atomic system in a particular state, the coherent superposition of the atomic states, which is a nonabsorbing state. The exciting radiation creates an atomic coherence, such that the atom's evolution is prepared exactly out of phase with the incoming radiation and no absorption takes place. The chapter discusses the basic properties of an atomic system prepared with the coherent population-trapping superposition of states and outlines experimental observations concerned with the establishment of coherent trapping in different discrete systems. The chapter also discusses the theoretical and experimental aspects of trapping that involve states of the continuum and reviews the theoretical and experimental features associated with coherent population trapping in laser cooling, adiabatic transfer, lasing without inversion, pulse matching, and photon statistics. The theoretical aspect of coherent population trapping created by spontaneous emission is also discussed in the chapter. },

  Abstract                 = {Photoassociation rates of mixed cold alkali atom pairs and formation rates of cold heteronuclear alkali dimers in their ground state are computed within an approach where the wave functions are calculated exactly, and the laser field is treated as a perturbation. These rates are predicted to have the same magnitude for all heteronuclear species involving either Rb or Cs atoms. Moreover, these rates are found slightly smaller than, or similar to, the same rates for Cs 2 molecules, which is encouraging for future experiments. We studied the specific case of the photoassociation into excited molecular states coupled with spin-orbit interaction, emphasizing the role of the so-called resonant coupling in the formation of stable ultracold molecules with low vibrational levels. The comparison with recent experimental results on RbCs photoassociation and cold molecule formation show their reasonable agreement with our calculations.},

  Abstract                 = {We have developed external cavity diode lasers, where the wavelength selection is assured by a low loss interference filter instead of the common diffraction grating. The filter allows a linear cavity design reducing the sensitivity of the wavelength and the external cavity feedback against misalignment. By separating the feedback and wavelength selection functions, both can be optimized independently leading to an increased tunability of the laser. The design is employed for the generation of laser light at 698, 780 and 852&#xa0;nm. Its characteristics make it a well suited candidate for space-born lasers. },

Collisions between H atoms and vibrationally excited \{H2\} molecules are investigated. Zero energy cross sections for all vibrational states of \{H2\} and the corresponding complex scattering lengths are reported using accurate quantum mechanical calculations. We obtain large values of the elastic cross sections which we attribute to s-wave bound and quasi-bound states of H⋯H2(v). The energies and lifetimes of the quasi-bound states are extracted from the complex scattering lengths. },

  Abstract                 = {Two computer programs (FGHEVEN and FGHFFT) for solving the one-dimensional Schrödinger equation for bound-state eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are presented. Both computer programs are based on the Fourier grid Hamiltonian method (J. Chem. Phys. 91 (1989) 3571). The method is exceptionally simple and robust. It relies on using the momentum representation for the kinetic energy operator and the coordinate representation for the potential energy. The first computer program (FGHEVEN) is based on an explicit (very simple) expression for the Hamiltonian matrix. The eigenvalues of this matrix give the required bound-state energies and the eigenvectors yield directly the eigenfunctions evaluated on the regularly spaced grid points. In this paper the theory has been slightly extended to encompass the situation where an even number of grid points is used. The second program (FGHFFT) is based on a complimentary theory which makes use of the discrete fast Fourier transform technique to evaluate the Hamiltonian matrix. The programs are self-contained and include subroutines to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors needed. },

  Abstract                 = { ▪ Abstract We review the effective field theories (EFTs) developed for few-nucleon systems. These EFTs are controlled expansions in momenta, where certain (leading-order) interactions are summed to all orders. At low energies, an EFT with only contact interactions allows a detailed analysis of renormalization in a nonperturbative context and uncovers novel asymptotic behavior. Manifestly model-independent calculations can be carried out to high orders, leading to high precision. At higher energies, an EFT that includes pion fields justifies and extends the traditional framework of phenomenological potentials. The correct treatment of QCD symmetries ensures a connection with lattice QCD. Several tests and prospects of these EFTs are discussed. },

  Abstract                 = {The momentum space zero-range model is used to investigate universal properties of three interacting particles confined to two dimensions. The pertinent equations are first formulated for a system of two identical and one distinct particle and the two different two-body subsystems are characterized by two-body energies and masses. The three-body energy in units of one of the two-body energies is a universal function of the other two-body energy and the mass ratio. We derive convenient analytical formulae for calculations of the three-body energy as a function of these two independent parameters and exhibit the results as universal curves. In particular, we show that the three-body system can have any number of stable bound states. When the mass ratio of the distinct to identical particles is greater than 0.22, we find that at most two stable bound states exist, while for two heavy and one light mass an increasing number of bound states is possible. The specific number of stable bound states depends on the ratio of two-body bound state energies and on the mass ratio, and we map out an energy–mass phase diagram of the number of stable bound states. Realizable systems of both fermions and bosons are discussed in this framework.},

  Abstract                 = {We consider three-body systems in two dimensions with zero-range interactions for general masses and interaction strengths. The momentum-space Schrödinger equation is solved numerically and in the Born–Oppenheimer (BO) approximation. The BO expression is derived using separable potentials and yields a concise adiabatic potential between the two heavy particles. The BO potential is Coulomb-like and exponentially decreasing at small and large distances, respectively. While we find similar qualitative features to previous studies, we find important quantitative differences. Our results demonstrate that mass-imbalanced systems that are accessible in the field of ultracold atomic gases can have a rich three-body bound state spectrum in two-dimensional geometries. Small light–heavy mass ratios increase the number of bound states. For 87 Rb– 87 Rb– 6 Li and 133 Cs– 133 Cs– 6 Li we find respectively three and four bound states.},

  Abstract                 = {We study the two-dimensional three-body problem in the general case of three distinguishable particles interacting through zero-range potentials. The Faddeev decomposition is used to write the momentum-space wave function. We show that the large-momentum asymptotic spectator function has the same functional form as derived previously for three identical particles. We derive the analytic relations between the three different Faddeev components for the three distinguishable particles. We investigate the one-body momentum distributions both analytically and numerically and analyze the tail of the distributions to obtain two- and three-body contact parameters. We specialize from the general cases to the examples of two identical, interacting or non-interacting, particles. We find that the two-body contact parameter is not a universal constant in the general case and show that the universality is recovered when a subsystem is composed of two identical non-interacting particles. We also show that the three-body contact parameter is negligible in the case of one non-interacting subsystem compared to the situation where all the subsystems are bound. As an example, we present the results for mixtures of lithium with two cesium or two potassium atoms, which are systems of current experimental interest.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a high resolution objective lens made entirely from catalog singlets that has a numerical aperture of 0.36. It corrects for aberrations introduced by a glass window and has a long working distance of 35 mm, making it suitable for imaging objects within a vacuum system. This offers simple high resolution imaging for many in the quantum gas community. The objective achieves a resolution of 1.3 \&\#x003BC;m at the design wavelength of 780 nm, and a diffraction-limited field of view of 360 \&\#x003BC;m when imaging through a 5 mm thick window. Images of a resolution target and a pinhole show quantitative agreement with the simulated lens performance. The objective is suitable for diffraction-limited monochromatic imaging on the D2 line of all the alkalis by changing only the aperture diameter, retaining numerical apertures above 0.32. The design corrects for window thicknesses of up to 15 mm if the singlet spacings are modified.},

  Abstract                 = { Inspired by the spectacular successes in the field of cold atoms, there is currently great interest in cold molecules. Cooling molecules is useful for various fundamental physics studies and gives access to an exotic regime in chemistry where the wave property of the molecules becomes important. Although cooling molecules has turned out to be considerably more difficult than cooling atoms, a number of methods to produce samples of cold molecules have been demonstrated over the last few years. This paper aims to review the application of cold molecules and the methods to produce them. Emphasis is put on the deceleration of polar molecules using time-varying electric fields. The operation principle of the array of electrodes that is used to decelerate polar molecules is described in analogy with, and using terminology from, charged-particle accelerators. It is shown that, by applying an appropriately timed high voltage burst, molecules can be decelerated while the phase-space density, i.e. the number of molecules per position-velocity interval, remains constant. In this way the high density and low temperature in the moving frame of a pulsed molecular beam can be transferred to the laboratory frame. Experiments on metastable CO in states that are either repelled by or attracted to high electric fields are presented. Loading of slow molecules into traps and storage rings is discussed. },

We show how to reach the scattering length and the number of bound states via the variable phase method. The scattering lengths of the singlet and triplet states of 7 Li 133 Cs are 50.5a.u. and — 135.7a.u., respectively. We derive two corrections, arising from long range interactions, accurately to at least first order, which provide upper and lower computed bounds to the scattering length. Our results are consistent with the recent experimental data and the theoretical calculation.},

  Abstract                 = {We describe the operation of a laser-cooled rubidium 87 Rb frequency standard. We present a new measurement of the 87 Rb hyperfine frequency with a 1.3 × 10 ?14 relative accuracy, by comparison with a Cs fountain primary standard. The measured 87 Rb ground-state hyperfine splitting is ? 87 = 6 834 682 610.90429(9) Hz. This value differs from previously published values (see Essen L., Hope E. G. and Sutcliffe D., Nature 189 1961 298; Penselin S., Moran T., Cohen W. and Wscinkler G., Phys. Rev. 127 1962 524; Arditi M. and Cerez P. IEEE Trans. Instrum. Meas. IM-21 1972 391) by about 2 ? 3 Hz and is 10 4 times more accurate. Because of the low collisional shift in 87 Rb, future improvements may lead to a stability of 1 × 10 ?14 ? ?1/2 and a relative accuracy in the 10 ?17 range.},

  Abstract                 = {Few-body physics has played a prominent role in atomic, molecular and nuclear physics since the early days of quantum mechanics. It is now possible—thanks to tremendous progress in cooling, trapping and manipulating ultracold samples—to experimentally study few-body phenomena in trapped atomic and molecular systems with unprecedented control. This review summarizes recent studies of few-body phenomena in trapped atomic and molecular gases, with an emphasis on small trapped systems. We start by introducing the free-space scattering properties and then investigate what happens when two particles, bosons or fermions, are placed in an external confinement. Next, various three-body systems are treated analytically in limiting cases. Our current understanding of larger two-component Fermi systems and Bose systems is reviewed, and connections with the corresponding bulk systems are established. Lastly, future prospects and challenges are discussed. Throughout this review, commonalities with other systems such as nuclei or quantum dots are highlighted.},

The shape resonance arises from a quasi-bound state inside a centrifugal barrier that enhances the excitation to the bound electronically excited state by the photoassociation laser in the time-independent experiment. The shape resonance is sufficiently long-lived that its build-up through the barrier can be observed by first depleting it via a photoassociation laser pulse and then measuring the rate of photoassociation by a second laser pulse with a variable delay time. A combined method of analysis of the time-independent and time-dependent experiments is presented. We discuss the spectroscopy of states of two particles with spin trapped inside a centrifugal barrier, interacting via direct and indirect spin-spin interactions.},

  Abstract                 = {We investigate the scattering cross section of aligned dipolar molecules in low-temperature gases. Over a wide range of collision energies relevant to contemporary experiments, the cross section declines in inverse proportion to the collision speed, and is given nearly exactly by a simple semiclassical formula. At yet lower energies, the cross section becomes independent of energy, and is reproduced within the Born approximation to within corrections due to the s-wave scattering length. While these behaviors are universal for all polar molecules, nevertheless interesting deviations from universality are expected to occur in the intermediate energy range.},

The high-resolution spectroscopic study of some molecular excited states populated by photoassociation of cold atoms (photoassociative spectroscopy) gives a good illustration of this property. It provides accurate determinations of atomic radiative lifetimes, which are known to be sensitive tests for atomic calculations. A number of such analyses have been performed up to now, for all stable alkali atoms and for some other atomic species (Ca, Sr, Yb). A systematic review of these determinations is attempted here, with special attention paid to accuracy issues.},

In particular, we report on the observation and on the spectroscopic analysis of all the excited states that have actually been used for efficient detection of cold molecules stabilized in the triplet ground state. They are: the state connected to the 6s + 6p asymptote, the and (2)3ÃŽÂ  g states connected to the 6s + 5d asymptote and finally the state connected to the 6s + 7s asymptote. The detection through these states spans a wide range of laser energies, from 8000 to 16,500 cmÃ¢Ë†â€™1, obtained with different laser dyes and techniques. Information on the initial distribution of cold molecules among the different vibrational levels of the ground state is also provided. This spectroscopic knowledge is important when conceiving schemes for quantum manipulation, population transfer and optical detection of cold caesium molecules. },

  Abstract                 = {Strongly interacting systems consisting of particles that interact through a large scattering length satisfy universal relations that relate many of their central properties to the contact, which measures the number of pairs with small separations. We use the operator product expansion of quantum field theory to derive the universal relation for the inelastic two-body loss rate. A simple universal relation between the loss rate and the contact is obtained by truncating the expansion after the lowest dimension operator. We verify the universal relation explicitly by direct calculations in the low-density limit at nonzero temperature. This universal relation can be tested experimentally using ultracold quantum gases of atoms in hyperfine states that have an inelastic spin-relaxation channel.},

The ionized heavy particles were detected in coincidence with the resulting electrons. This method allows the determination of detection efficiencies without a knowledge of the absolute event rates. We obtained the detection efficiencies for the ions H 2 + , D 2 + , HD + , H + , D + and Ar + in the impact energy range 0-5 keV. The detection efficiencies saturate above 3 keV and reach generally 41%. This value seems to reflect mainly the physically effective area of the MCP.},

  Abstract                 = {Quantum control is concerned with active manipulation of physical and chemical processes on the atomic and molecular scale. This work presents a perspective of progress in the field of control over quantum phenomena, tracing the evolution of theoretical concepts and experimental methods from early developments to the most recent advances. Among numerous theoretical insights and technological improvements that produced the present state-of-the-art in quantum control, there have been several breakthroughs of foremost importance. On the technology side, the current experimental successes would be impossible without the development of intense femtosecond laser sources and pulse shapers. On the theory side, the two most critical insights were (i) realizing that ultrafast atomic and molecular dynamics can be controlled via manipulation of quantum interferences and (ii) understanding that optimally shaped ultrafast laser pulses are the most effective means for producing the desired quantum interference patterns in the controlled system. Finally, these theoretical and experimental advances were brought together by the crucial concept of adaptive feedback control (AFC), which is a laboratory procedure employing measurement-driven, closed-loop optimization to identify the best shapes of femtosecond laser control pulses for steering quantum dynamics towards the desired objective. Optimization in AFC experiments is guided by a learning algorithm, with stochastic methods proving to be especially effective. AFC of quantum phenomena has found numerous applications in many areas of the physical and chemical sciences, and this paper reviews the extensive experiments. Other subjects discussed include quantum optimal control theory, quantum control landscapes, the role of theoretical control designs in experimental realizations and real-time quantum feedback control. The paper concludes with a perspective of open research directions that are likely to attract significant attention in the future.},

The application of femtosecond pulses resulted in a reduction, rather than an increase, in the rate of detection of 85Rb2 and 87Rb2 triplet ground-state a 3 ÃŽÂ£ u + molecules, and compared this to the effects of non-chirped pulses, continuous-wave light, and the formation rate when no additional light was applied. A dependence on the amount of chirp of the femtosecond laser pulses suggests that the reduction in the molecular signal is the result of a coherent effect, and provides a promising indication that coherent control could be used to engineer the production of ultracold molecules.},

The capability to arbitrarily shape strong electric fields gives the possibility of dynamically sculpting the system Hamiltonian on the collisional timescale. In this paper we explore theoretically physically intuitive excitation schemes by which a control field can manipulate the vibronic state populations in an ultracold molecular system, with the goal of bringing atom pairs to short ( R < 10 Ãƒâ€¦) separations where they may form a tightly bound molecule. The microscopic dynamics of individual pairs of colliding atoms under the influence of an external optical field are explored through explicitly time-dependent numerical simulations. The results provide physical justification for the employment of optimal control techniques for the achievement of state-selective formation of ultracold molecules.},

  Abstract                 = {Long-range energy matrix elements have been calculated in the multipolar expansion approximation for all the molecular states dissociating to the three or four lowest asymptotes for the molecules LiNa, LiK, LiRb, LiCs, NaK, NaRb, NaCs, KRb, KCs and RbCs using the semi-empirical perturbative model we proposed recently. Two different assumptions have been investigated: including or excluding the spin-orbit effects within each atom. Full numerical results are presented for NaK and LiCs which have been chosen as examples. For the ten molecules in the non-interacting assumption the long-range coefficients C6 and C8 have been found for each state when neglecting atomic spin-orbit effects while the fitted value C*6 and C*8 are presented for each state when including atomic spin-orbit effects. When considering the interacting states, those dissociating to ns + nâ€²s and to ns + 5d(Cs) are seen to be slightly perturbed while the states dissociating to ns + nâ€²p and to np + nâ€²s are significantly perturbed. The wavefunctions for the interacting 3Î£+, 3Î , 0+, 0âˆ’, 1, 2 states for the molecules NaK and LiCs are presented for various internuclear distances.},

  Abstract                 = { Eighteen spinÃ¢Ë†â€™orbit states are generated from the open-shell open-shell Si(3P) + OH(X2ÃŽÂ ) interacting system. We present here the behavior of the associated long-range intermolecular potentials, following a multipolar expansion of the Coulombic interaction treated up to second order of the perturbation theory, giving rise to a series of terms varying in RÃ¢Ë†â€™n. In the present work, we have considered the electrostatic dipoleÃ¢Ë†â€™quadrupole (n = 4) and quadrupoleÃ¢Ë†â€™quadrupole (n = 5) interactions, as well as the dipoleÃ¢Ë†â€™induced dipoleÃ¢Ë†â€™induced dispersion (n = 6) and dipoleÃ¢Ë†â€™dipole-induced induction (n = 6) contributions. The diatomic OH is kept fixed at its ground state-averaged distance, (r)v=0 = 1.865 bohr, so that the long-range potentials are two-dimensional potential energy surfaces (PESs) that depend on the intermolecular distance R and on the bending angle ÃŽÂ³ = Ã¢Ë†Â SiGH, where G represents the mass center of OH. From the calculated properties of the monomers, such as the dipole and quadrupole moments and static and dynamic polarizabilities, we have determined and tabulated the long-range coefficients of the multipolar expansion of the potentials for each matrix elements. The isolated monomer spinÃ¢Ë†â€™orbit splittings have been included in the final matrix, whose diagonalization gives rise to 18 adiabatic potentials. Then, the adiabatic states have been compared to potential energies given by supermolecular ab initio calculations resulting in a general good overall agreement. },

  Abstract                 = {At ultracold temperatures, the Pauli exclusion principle suppresses collisions between identical fermions. This has motivated the development of atomic clocks with fermionic isotopes. However, by probing an optical clock transition with thousands of lattice-confined, ultracold fermionic strontium atoms, we observed density-dependent collisional frequency shifts. These collision effects were measured systematically and are supported by a theoretical description attributing them to inhomogeneities in the probe excitation process that render the atoms distinguishable. This work also yields insights for zeroing the clock density shift.},

This potential, which is harmonic for small radii and decays as a Gaussian for large radii, models experimentally relevant optical traps. The nonlinearity, which is proportional to both the number of atoms and the interaction strength, can transform bound states into quasi-bound ones. The latter have a finite lifetime due to tunnelling through the barriers at the borders of the well. We predict the lifetime and stability properties for repulsive and attractive condensates in one, two and three dimensions, for both the ground state and excited soliton and vortex states. We show, via a combination of the variational and WKB approximations, that macroscopic quantum tunnelling in such systems can be observed on time scales of 10 ms to 10 s.},

Ultracold molecules offer promising applications such as new platforms for quantum computing, precise control of molecular dynamics, nanolithography and Bose-enhanced chemistry.

After a brief historical introduction, advances in the generation and state selection of beams of reactants, and in the schemes for product detection, which are at the basis of our increased ability to measure state-averaged and state-resolved reactive differential cross sections in crossed beam experiments, are described. The novel couplings of laser and synchrotron radiation to these experiments are noted. A selection of case studies are considered in some detail, to exemplify recent improvements in our understanding of gas-phase neutral reaction dynamics. The examples include prototype reactions involving three-atom and four-atom systems, and the results are discussed in the light of the most recent, synergistic, theoretical developments for treating both the potential energy surfaces and the reaction dynamics. Progress made in studies of reactions of molecular radicals and of chemically important atoms, such as carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, with polyatomic molecules, as made possible by recent developments in the classic crossed beam technique with mass spectrometric detection, is emphasized. Some complementary techniques that recently have contributed to our understanding of chemical reactivity are also described briefly.},

  Abstract                 = {Two elementary models of molecular structure are used to investigate inelastic collisions in cold trapped dipolar gases. A two-state model of a polar molecule (such as one with a ÃŽâ€º-doublet) permits analytic description of the inelastic collision process at energies considerably higher than the gap energy, predicting rate constants and cross sections given by elementary formulae. Alternatively, a three-state model of a rotor molecule in an electric field is investigated, with resultant rate constants and cross sections scaling simply with molecular mass, rotational constant, dipole moment and polarizing field strength. Semiclassical inelastic collision cross sections and rate constants are demonstrated to depend strongly on the model used, especially as regards their dependence on the polarizing field. Inelastic cross sections among doublet dipoles decrease with increasing field strength, while they increase in proportion to the square of the field strength for collisions between rotor dipoles.},

Quantum degeneracy of rubidium atoms is reached by direct evaporative cooling in both crossed- and single-beam trapping geometries. At the heart of these all-optical condensation experiments is the ability to obtain high initial atomic densities in quasi-static dipole traps by laser-cooling techniques. Finally, we demonstrate the formation of a condensate in a field-insensitive m F =0 spin projection only, which suppresses fluctuations of the chemical potential from stray magnetic fields.},

  Abstract                 = {We study the effects of a static electric field on the photoassociation of a heteronuclear atom pair into a polar molecule. The interaction of permanent dipole moment with a static electric field largely affects the ground state continuum wavefunction of the atom pair at short separations where photoassociation transitions occur according to the FranckÃ¢â‚¬â€œCondon principle. Electric field-induced anisotropic interaction between two heteronuclear ground state atoms leads to scattering resonances at some specific electric fields. Near such resonances the amplitude of the scattering wavefunction at short separation increases by several orders of magnitude. As a result, the photoassociation rate is enhanced by several orders of magnitude near the resonances. We discuss in detail electric field-modified atomÃ¢â‚¬â€œatom scattering properties and resonances. We calculate the photoassociation rate that shows giant enhancement due to electric field tunable anisotropic resonances. We present selected results among which particularly important are the excitations of higher rotational levels in ultracold photoassociation due to electric field tunable resonances.},

  Abstract                 = {The reaction of F with H2 and its isotopomers is the paradigm for an exothermic triatomic abstraction reaction. In a crossed-beam scattering experiment, we determined relative integral and differential cross sections for reaction of the ground F(2P3/2) and excited F*(2P1/2) spin-orbit states with D2 for collision energies of 0.25 to 1.2 kilocalorie/mole. At the lowest collision energy, F* is âˆ¼1.6 times more reactive than F, although reaction of F* is forbidden within the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation. As the collision energy increases, the BO-allowed reaction rapidly dominates. We found excellent agreement between multistate, quantum reactive scattering calculations and both the measured energy dependence of the F*/F reactivity ratio and the differential cross sections. This agreement confirms the fundamental understanding of the factors controlling electronic nonadiabaticity in abstraction reactions.},

  Abstract                 = {We review the \{BCS\} to Boseâ€“Einstein condensation (BEC) crossover scenario which is based on the well known crossover generalization of the \{BCS\} ground state wavefunction Î¨ 0 . While this ground state has been summarized extensively in the literature, this Review is devoted to less widely discussed issues: understanding the effects of finite temperature, primarily below T c , in a manner consistent with Î¨ 0 . Our emphasis is on the intersection of two important problems: high T c superconductivity and superfluidity in ultracold fermionic atomic gases. We address the â€œpseudogap stateâ€� in the copper oxide superconductors from the vantage point of a BCSâ€“BEC crossover scenario, although there is no consensus on the applicability of this scheme to high T c . We argue that it also provides a useful basis for studying atomic gases near the unitary scattering regime; they are most likely in the counterpart pseudogap phase. That is, superconductivity takes place out of a non-Fermi liquid state where preformed, metastable fermion pairs are present at the onset of their Bose condensation. As a microscopic basis for this work, we summarize a variety of T-matrix approaches, and assess their theoretical consistency. A close connection with conventional superconducting fluctuation theories is emphasized and exploited. },

We review the experimental and theoretical literature on cold gases and the photoemission spectroscopy of the cuprates particularly as it pertains to areas of overlap. In addition to a comparison with the cuprates, this paper contains a systematic overview of the theory of RF spectroscopy, both momentum integrated and momentum resolved. It should be noted that the integrated and momentum resolved forms of photoemission are equally important in the high T c cuprate literature. For the cold gases we introduce the reader to such topical issues as the effects of traps, population imbalance, final state interactions and, over the entire range of temperatures, we compare theory and experiment. We show that this broad range of phenomena can be accommodated within the BCS-Leggett description of BCSâ€“BEC crossover. Importantly, this scheme captures some of the central observations in photoemission experiments in the cuprates.},

  Abstract                 = {Ultracold molecules offer brand new opportunities to probe the variation of fundamental constants with unprecedented sensitivity. This paper summarizes theoretical background and current constraints on the variation of the fine structure constant and electron-to-proton mass ratio, as well as proposals and experimental efforts to measure the variations based on ultracold molecules. In particular, we describe two novel spectroscopic schemes on ultracold molecules that have greatly enhanced sensitivity to fundamental constants: resonant scattering near Feshbach resonances and spectroscopy on close-lying energy levels of ultracold molecules.},

  Abstract                 = {In this article, we present a tutorial discussion of the coherence properties of Bose–Einstein condensates. We use a formalism which is similar to the one used in quantum optics. We describe within the variational approximation the question of the relative phase of two condensates. To evaluate the structure factors of a condensate, we briefly review the Bogolubov approach and describe light scattering off a condensate using the linear response formalism. Finally, we study the effect of atomic interactions on the condensate's dynamics. },

  Abstract                 = {A general study has been made of the bound states of a charged particle in a static field which behaves as the dipole form asymptotically. When the field is that of either a point dipole plus a sufficiently repulsive spherical core, or a finite dipole, the existence of bound states of the charged particle depends only on the value of the reduced dipole moment K (equation (5)). It is shown that each symmetry class of states has its own threshold value of K such that states of that symmetry exist if, and only if, K exceeds the critical minimum. There is an infinite number of states of given symmetry when there are any. Critical values of K < 100 are calculated. When the potential has an arbitrary form at short range (but still has the dipole form at long range), the situation remains much the same as above, with the exception that sufficient attraction at short range will allow some states to exist for any value of the dipole moment.},

  Abstract                 = {We show that the dressed-atom approach provides a quantitative understanding of the main features of radiative dipole forces (mean value, fluctuations, velocity dependence) in the high-intensity limit where perturbative treatments are no longer valid. In an inhomogeneous laser beam, the energies of the dressed states vary in space, and this gives rise to dressed-state-dependent forces. Spontaneous transitions between dressed states lead to a multivalued instantaneous force fluctuating around a mean value. The velocity dependence of the mean force is related to the modification, induced by the atomic motion, of the population balance between the different dressed states. The corresponding modification of the atomic energy is associated with a change of the fluorescence spectrum emitted by the atom. The particular case of atomic motion in a standing wave is investigated, and two regimes are identified in which the mean dipole force averaged over a wavelength exhibits a simple velocity dependence. The large values of this force achievable with reasonable laser powers are pointed out with view to slowing down atoms with dipole forces.},

  Abstract                 = {Molecular cooling techniques face the hurdle of dissipating translational as well as internal energy in the presence of a rich electronic, vibrational, and rotational energy spectrum. In our experiment, we create a translationally ultracold, dense quantum gas of molecules bound by more than 1000 wave numbers in the electronic ground state. Specifically, we stimulate with 80% efficiency, a two-photon transfer of molecules associated on a Feshbach resonance from a Bose-Einstein condensate of cesium atoms. In the process, the initial loose, long-range electrostatic bond of the Feshbach molecule is coherently transformed into a tight chemical bond. We demonstrate coherence of the transfer in a Ramsey-type experiment and show that the molecular sample is not heated during the transfer. Our results show that the preparation of a quantum gas of molecules in specific rovibrational states is possible and that the creation of a Bose-Einstein condensate of molecules in their rovibronic ground state is within reach.},

Here{,} in ultracold samples of Cs2 Feshbach molecules produced out of ultracold samples of Cs atoms{,} we observe several optical transitions to deeply-bound rovibrational levels of the excited 0u+ molecular potentials with high resolution. At least one of these transitions{,} although rather weak{,} allows efficient STIRAP transfer into the deeply-bound vibrational level |v = 73> of the singlet X1[capital Sigma]g+ ground state potential{,} as recently demonstrated (J.

The calculations rely on an ab initio pseudo-potential, Core Polarization Potential operators for the coreÃ¢â‚¬â€œvalence correlation and full valence CI approaches, combined to an efficient diabatization procedure. For the low-lying states, our spectroscopic constants and vibrational level spacing are in good agreement with the available experimental data. Diabatic potentials and permanent dipole moments are analyzed, revealing the strong imprint of the ionic state in the 1 ÃŽÂ£ + adiabatic states.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose a method of controlling two-atom interaction using both magnetic and laser fields. We analyse the role of quantum interference between magnetic and optical Feshbach resonances in controlling cold collision. In particular, we demonstrate that this method allows us to suppress inelastic and enhance elastic scattering cross sections. Quantum interference is shown to modify significantly the threshold behaviour and resonant interaction of ultracold atoms. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to manipulate not only the spherically symmetric s-wave interaction but also the anisotropic higher partial-wave interactions which are particularly important for high-temperature superfluid or superconducting phases of matter.},

Two-photon dark state spectroscopy connects the initial Feshbach state to the rovibronic ground state.

The momentum states produced in this way oscillate in the trap for time scales on the order of seconds, nearly unperturbed by collisions, which are absent for ultracold fermions due to the Pauli principle. In contrast, interactions in a mixture with 87 Rb atoms lead to rapid damping. The coherence of these states is demonstrated by Ramsey-type matter wave interferometry. The signal is improved using an echo pulse sequence, allowing us to observe coherence times longer than 100 ÃŽÂ¼s. Finally, we use Bragg spectroscopy to measure the in-situ momentum distribution of the 6 Li cloud. Signatures for the degeneracy of the Fermi gas can be observed directly from the momentum distribution of the atoms inside the trap.},

Rev. Lett. 101 133004). Absolute rate constants for photoassociation at large detunings from the atomic asymptote are determined and are found to be surprisingly large. The photoassociation process is modeled using a full coupled-channel calculation for the continuum state, taking all relevant hyperfine states into account. The enhancement of the photoassociation rate is found to be caused by an 'echo' of the triplet component in the singlet component of the scattering wave function at the inner turning point of the lowest triplet a 3 ? + potential. This perturbation can be ascribed to the existence of a broad Feshbach resonance at low scattering energies. Our results elucidate the important role of couplings in the scattering wave function for the formation of deeply bound ground state molecules via photoassociation.},

With this formalism channel wavefunctions for many-particle channels are formally identical to the usual two-particle wavefunctions and require no special treatment. The scattering matrix referring to open channels is unitary and symmetric when many-particle channels are included; its symmetries in the complex k-plane are also discussed. Long-range effects in many-particle channels are considered, and it is shown that these can modify the threshold behaviour of matrix elements given previously. Effective range expansions, valid for many-particle channels, are given for the reactance matrix and eigenphaseshifts. },

  Abstract                 = {We discuss several issues important for experimentally observing Efimov physics in ultracold quantum gases. By numerically solving the three-boson Schrödinger equation over a broad range of scattering lengths and energies, and by including model potentials with multiple bound states, we address the complications of relating experimental observations to available analytic expressions. These more realistic potentials introduce features that can mask the predicted Efimov physics at small scattering lengths. They also allow us to verify that positive and negative scattering lengths are universally connected only across a pole, not across a zero. Additionally, we show that the spacing between Efimov features for the relatively small scattering lengths accessible experimentally fails to precisely follow the geometric progression expected for Efimov physics. Finally, we emphasize the importance of the short-range three-body physics in determining the position of Efimov features and show that theoretically reproducing two-body physics is not generally sufficient to predict three-body properties quantitatively.},

As a special case, resonant s-wave scattering in the presence of a dipole potential is worked out in detail. An exactly solvable dynamical model for electron-HCl scattering is proposed and is shown to reproduce the essential features of the vibrational excitation functions of HCl measured by Rohr and Linder (1976). Particular emphasis is given to the analysis of the analytic properties of the S matrix and related quantities in the fixed-nuclei approximation. The passage of a resonance through threshold is shown to be a non-trivial phenomenon for polar molecules. The authors propose a re-interpretation of the HCl - potential energy curves obtained by the stabilisation method.},

  abstract =             {When atoms in a gas are cooled to extremely low temperatures, they will—under the appropriate conditions—condense into a single quantum-mechanical state known as a Bose–Einstein condensate. In such systems, quantum-mechanical behaviour is evident on a macroscopic scale. Here we explore the dynamics of how a Bose–Einstein condensate collapses and subsequently explodes when the balance of forces governing its size and shape is suddenly altered. A condensate's equilibrium size and shape is strongly affected by the interatomic interactions. Our ability to induce a collapse by switching the interactions from repulsive to attractive by tuning an externally applied magnetic field yields detailed information on the violent collapse process. We observe anisotropic atom bursts that explode from the condensate, atoms leaving the condensate in undetected forms, spikes appearing in the condensate wavefunction and oscillating remnant condensates that survive the collapse. All these processes have curious dependences on time, on the strength of the interaction and on the number of condensate atoms. Although the system would seem to be simple and well characterized, our measurements reveal many phenomena that challenge theoretical models.},

The release rate of copper and oxides in water is affected by several variables: dissolved oxygen concentration, pH, and temperature. Relative corrosion rate, solubility data, and operating regimes are summarized based on previous work by others. Mechanisms for oxide release are discussed, and a means of pH control employing an ion exchange process is described},

This leads to the determination of the scattering length. We performed photoassociation of cold Cs atoms polarized in the Zeeman sublevel f = 4, mf = 4. We analyzed the intensities of the lines associated with the Cs2 0g- state dissociating to the 6s1/2+6p3/2 asymptote. This yields a value of the Cs triplet state scattering length, aT = -530a0, while consistency requirements impose a value of the multipole ground state molecular coefficient, C6 = 6510 a.u.},

  Abstract                 = {In recent years several groups of researchers have succeeded in making samples of cold molecules, at temperatures below 1 K, and of ultracold molecules, at temperatures below 1 mK. We concentrate on the formation of Cs2 dimers. Starting with laser-cooled atoms, photoassociation forms molecules in an excited electronic state. Various mechanisms are presented for stabilizing these molecules by spontaneous emission into a bound level of the ground electronic state. The design of new formation schemes requires precise knowledge of molecular potential curves that is well beyond the accuracy of ab initio calculations. We show that analytical long-range potentials can be fitted on photoassociation spectra and yield, through the determination of the C3 long-range coefficient, a value of the radiative lifetime of the 6P3/2 cesium level with an unprecedented accuracy. For short-range potentials it is possible to avoid explicit calculations by using asymptotic methods that generalize to long-range molecules the quantum-defect concepts developed for Rydberg atoms. Considering two coupled channels, we show how generalized Lu--Fano plots can extract precise information from experimental spectra.},

It focuses on the numerous recipes which are now available, or proposed, for creating cold molecules of various species and in various environments. Several papers illustrate the amazingly detailed knowledge which can be extracted from their study, opening the way to the ultimate control of elementary chemical processes by mastering both the preparation of the initial state and the reaction path. In this introductory review, we will review the main stages of the developments of research on cold molecules, as reflected by the accompanying series of papers.},

It covers extensively the experimental methods to produce, detect and characterize cold and ultracold molecules including association of ultracold atoms, deceleration by external fields and kinematic cooling. Confinement of molecules in different kinds of traps is also discussed. The basic theoretical issues related to the knowledge of the molecular structure, the atomÃ¢â‚¬â€œmolecule and moleculeÃ¢â‚¬â€œmolecule mutual interactions, and to their possible manipulation and control with external fields, are reviewed. A short discussion on the broad area of applications completes the review.},

For the B1Î  state, we have observed rotational perturbations in the e-parity component of the vâ€² = 2 level, and determined the dissociation energy. We discuss implications of our measurements in finding efficient photoassociation pathways for production of ultracold ground state LiRb molecules, and their detection via state selective ionization.},

  Abstract                 = {As shown recently, resonances in the pairwise forces result in the appearance of a specific series of levels in the three-particle spectrum. The number of levels may be very large, they lie near the three-body break-up threshold, have characteristic quantum numbers and are of large spatial size. This work represents a detailed analysis of this effect for various particle mass ratios. The effect is shown to exist at all mass ratios, the resonances acting in the forces of all the pairs or two pairs of particles only. The most favourable for the appearance of the series is the case of one particle being much lighter than the other two, while interacting resonantly with them. The physical pattern of the effect, the level spectrum structure and the spatial structure of the states are studied for all mass ratios. The studies of the effect permits one to draw some qualitative conclusions concerning the character of the overall three-particle level spectrum. },

  Abstract                 = {We present spectrally resolved pump-probe experiments on the photoassociation of ultracold rubidium atoms with shaped ultrashort laser pulses. The pump pulse causes a free-bound transition leading to a coherent transient signal of rubidium molecules in the first excited state. In order to achieve a high frequency resolution the bandwidth of the pump pulse is reduced to a few wavenumbers. The frequency dependence of the transient signal close to the D1 atomic resonance is investigated for characteristic pump-probe delay times. The observed spectra, which show a pronounced dip for pump-probe coincidence, are interpreted using quantum dynamical calculations.},

  Abstract                 = {We present an all-solid-state laser source emitting up to 2.1 W of single-frequency light at 671 nm developed for laser cooling of lithium atoms. It is based on a diode-pumped, neodymium-doped orthovanadate (Nd:YVO4) ring laser operating at 1342 nm. Optimization of the thermal management in the gain medium results in a maximum multi-frequency output power of 2.5 W at the fundamental wavelength. We develop a simple theory for the efficient implementation of intracavity second harmonic generation, and its application to our system allows us to obtain nonlinear conversion efficiencies of up to 88\&\#x00025;. Single-mode operation and tuning is established by adding an etalon to the resonator. The second-harmonic wavelength can be tuned over 0.5 nm, and mode-hop-free scanning over more than 6 GHz is demonstrated, corresponding to around ten times the laser cavity free spectral range. The output frequency can be locked with respect to the lithium D-line transitions for atomic physics applications. Furthermore, we observe parametric Kerr-lens mode-locking when detuning the phase-matching temperature sufficiently far from the optimum value.},

  Abstract                 = {Superconductivity and superfluidity of fermionic and bosonic systems are remarkable many-body quantum phenomena. In liquid helium and dilute gases, Bose and Fermi superfluidity has been observed separately, but producing a mixture in which both the fermionic and the bosonic components are superfluid is challenging. Here, we report on the observation of such a mixture with dilute gases of two Lithium isotopes, 6Li and 7Li. We probe the collective dynamics of this system by exciting center-of-mass oscillations that exhibit extremely low damping below a certain critical velocity. Using high precision spectroscopy of these modes we observe coherent energy exchange and measure the coupling between the two superfluids. Our observations can be captured theoretically using a sum-rule approach that we interpret in terms of two coupled oscillators.},

  Abstract                 = { Recent experiments on formation of translationally cold ground state molecules, their subsequent broadband vibrational cooling and study of rotations are presented together with the related modeling. We produce cold molecules by photoassociating pairs of cold cesium atoms that can decay into ground state molecules in different vibrational levels. Then we laser cool the vibrational degree of freedom by selecting a single target vibrational level. Our method is based on repeated optical pumping by laser light with a spectrum broad enough to excite all populated vibrational levels but limited in its frequency bandwidth with a spatial light modulator. In such a way we are able to eliminate transitions from the selected level, in which molecules accumulate. Results for vibrational cooling into the v = 0, v = 1, v = 2 and v = 7 level of the singlet X 1ÃŽÂ£ g ground electronic state are presented. Depletion spectroscopy is performed to study the rotational distribution of the created molecules. In the theoretical modeling of the process we are able to reproduce our results and investigate the prospects for a Ã¢â‚¬ËœcompleteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ cooling of molecules, including also their rotational degree of freedom. },

We report the reaction rate of 4.1H with 1H2 to produce 4.1H1H + 1H at 295 to 500 kelvin. The experimental rate constants are compared with the predictions of accurate quantum-mechanical dynamics calculations carried out on an accurate Born-Huang potential energy surface and with previously measured rate constants of 0.11H (where 0.11H is shorthand for muonium). Kinetic isotope effects can be compared for the unprecedentedly large mass ratio of 36. The agreement with accurate quantum dynamics is quantitative at 500 kelvin, and variational transition-state theory is used to interpret the extremely low (large inverse) kinetic isotope effects in the 10−4 to 10−2 range.},

  Abstract                 = {The theoretical status on universal aspects of weakly-bound neutron-rich light nuclei are reviewed, considering few-body approaches. We focus the review on the low-energy properties of light halo nuclei that can be treated within two- and three-body approaches (with one- and two-neutron halos), which are dominated by s -wave two-body interactions. The representative works studying the large two-neutron halos in light exotic nuclei with short-range interactions show that the general properties associated with the halo neutrons are model independent and obey scaling laws, which are functions of the low-energy observables of the neutron–neutron and neutron–core subsystems, with one additional scale that represents the physics of the three-body system at short-ranges. The scaling laws for the s -wave two-neutron halos are identified with limit-cycles in a renormalized zero-range three-body model. The necessary basic concepts for interpreting the physics of large halos, and also to treat the zero-range interaction in few-body systems, are given. },

  Abstract                 = {WKB wave functions are expected to be accurate approximations of exact quantum mechanical wave functions mainly near the semiclassical limit of the quantum mechanical SchrÃƒÂ¶dinger equation. The accuracy of WKB wave functions is, however, a local property of the SchrÃƒÂ¶dinger equation, and the failure of the WKB approximation may be restricted to a small Ã¢â‚¬Å“quantal regionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of coordinate space, even under conditions which are far from the semiclassical limit and close to the anticlassical or extreme quantum limit of the SchrÃƒÂ¶dinger equation. In many physically important situations, exact or highly accurate approximate wave functions are available for the quantal region where the WKB approximation breaks down, and together with WKB wave functions in residual space provide highly accurate solutions of the full problem. WKB wave functions can thus be used to derive exact or highly accurate quantum mechanical results, even far from the semiclassical limit. We present a wide range of applications, including the derivation of properties of bound and continuum states near the threshold of a potential, which are important for understanding many results observed in experiments with cold atoms.},

  Abstract                 = {Ultracold metastable RbCs molecules are observed in a double species magneto-optical trap through photoassociation near the Rb(5S1/2) + Cs(6P3/2) dissociation limit followed by radiative stabilization. The molecules are formed in their lowest triplet electronic state and are detected by resonance enhanced two-photon ionization through the previously unobserved (3)3[capital Pi] ? a 3[capital Sigma]+ band. The large rotational structure of the observed photoassociation lines is assigned to the lowest vibrational levels of the 0+ or 0- excited states correlated to the Rb(5P1/2) + Cs(6S1/2) dissociation limit. This demonstrates the possibility of inducing direct photoassociation in heteronuclear alkali-metal molecules at a short internuclear distance{,} as pointed out earlier [J. Deiglmayr et al.{,} Phys.

  Abstract                 = {Multiple scattering of light has been the main limitation of the maximum atomic density achievable in magneto-optical traps (MOTs). We present a detailed experimental investigation of the size and density scaling laws for large MOTs with up to N =10 10 atoms, larger than those usually studied in detail. Most of our observations can be explained with previous models and only a few regimes show unexplained deviations. We also propose a new repulsion mechanism, based on the rescattered repumper photons that might limit the atomic density of atoms when the optical thickness for repumper light becomes important, adding an additional ingredient in the complexity of large MOTs.},

  Abstract                 = {The spin-exchange frequency shift due to cold collisions between ground-state atoms appears to be the systematic effect which could limit the accuracy of a laser-cooled cesium fountain operating as a frequency standard. We have investigated this shift for atoms distributed among all the Zeeman substates of either the F = 4 or F = 3 hyperfine level of the 6 S 1/2 ground state of cesium and for the case where most of the atoms are prepared in F = 3, M F = 0 sublevel. The measured relative frequency shifts are respectively âˆ’ 1.0Â·10 âˆ’21 , âˆ’ 0.6Â·10 âˆ’21 and âˆ’ 2.0Â·10 âˆ’21 (at/cm 3 ) âˆ’1 . These results agree with the measurements performed by Gibble and Chu at higher atom densities with atoms prepared in F = 3, M F = 0 sublevel. However, the precision of our frequency measurements is much better and is only limited at 2Â·10 âˆ’15 by the H-maser used as a reference oscillator. Finally, we show that the relative frequency shift due to cold collisions can be reduced to 10 âˆ’15 , while preserving a short-term frequency stability of about 10 âˆ’13 Ï„ âˆ’1/2 .},

  Abstract                 = {We investigate the possibility of forming deeply bound ultracold RbCs molecules by a two-color photoassociation experiment. We compare the results with those for Rb 2 in order to understand the characteristic differences between heteronuclear and homonuclear molecules. The major differences arise from the different long-range potential for excited states. Ultracold 85 Rb and 133 Cs atoms colliding on the X 1 ÃŽÂ£ + potential curve are initially photoassociated to form excited RbCs molecules in the region below the Rb(5S)+Cs(6P 1/2 ) asymptote. We explore the nature of the ÃŽÂ©=0 + levels in this region, which have mixed A 1 ÃŽÂ£ + and b 3 ÃŽÂ  character. We then study the quantum dynamics of RbCs by a time-dependent wavepacket (TDWP) approach. A wavepacket is formed by exciting a few vibronic levels and is allowed to propagate on the coupled electronic potential energy curves. We calculate the time dependence of the overlap between the wavepacket and ground-state vibrational levels. For a detuning of 7.5 cm Ã¢Ë†â€™1 from the atomic line, the wavepacket for RbCs reaches the short-range region in about 13 ps, which is significantly faster than for the homonuclear Rb 2 system; this is mostly because of the absence of an R Ã¢Ë†â€™3 long-range tail in the excited-state potential curves for heteronuclear systems. We give a simple semiclassical formula that relates the time taken to the long-range potential parameters. For RbCs, in contrast to Rb 2 , the excited-state wavepacket shows a substantial peak in singlet density near the inner turning point, and this produces a significant probability of de-excitation to form ground-state molecules bound by up to 1500 cm Ã¢Ë†â€™1 . The short-range peak depends strongly on non-adiabatic coupling and is reduced if the strength of the spinÃ¢â‚¬â€œorbit coupling is increased. Our analysis of the role of spinÃ¢â‚¬â€œorbit coupling concerns the character of the mixed states in general and is important for both photoassociation and stimulated Raman de-excitation.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a new analysis of the electron capture mechanism in polar molecules, based on von Neumann's theory of self-adjoint extensions. Our analysis suggests that it is theoretically possible for polar molecules to form bound states with electrons, even with dipole moments smaller than the critical value D 0 = 1.63 × 10 −18 esu cm . We argue that the quantum mechanical scaling anomaly is responsible for the formation of these bound states. },

  Abstract                 = {We consider in detail the situation of applying a time-dependent external magnetic field to a 87 Rb atomic Boseâ€“Einstein condensate held in a harmonic trap, in order to adiabatically sweep the interatomic interactions across a Feshbach resonance to produce diatomic molecules. To this end, we introduce a minimal two-body Hamiltonian depending on just five measurable parameters of a Feshbach resonance, which accurately determines all low-energy binary scattering observables, in particular, the molecular conversion efficiency of just two atoms. Based on this description of the microscopic collision phenomena, we use the many-body theory of KÃ¶hler and Burnett (2002 Phys. Rev. A 65 033601) to study the efficiency of the association of molecules in a 87 Rb Boseâ€“Einstein condensate during a linear passage of the magnetic-field strength across the 100 mT Feshbach resonance. We explore different, experimentally accessible, parameter regimes, and compare the predictions of Landauâ€“Zener, configuration interaction, and two-level mean-field calculations with those of the microscopic many-body approach. Our comparative studies reveal a remarkable insensitivity of the molecular conversion efficiency with respect to both the details of the microscopic binary collision physics and the coherent nature of the Boseâ€“Einstein condensed gas, provided that the magnetic-field strength is varied linearly. We provide the reasons for this universality of the molecular production achieved by linear ramps of the magnetic-field strength, and identify the Landauâ€“Zener coefficient determined by Mies et al (2000 Phys. Rev. A 61 022721) as the main parameter that controls the efficiency.},

Afterwards, we introduce the basic elements of the main physical problem (an atom moving in a spatially modulated electromagnetic field) and we make a concise description of the various theoretical approaches that have been introduced in the literature in order to solve that problem. Finally, we report a detailed list of the multiple diagnostic tools that have been developed by physicists in order to investigate the static and dynamical properties of these systems. The new developments and the perspectives of the research field on optical lattices are then quickly discussed and conclude this introductory review.},

We observed the absence of mean-field â€œclockâ€� shifts, the dominant source of systematic error in current atomic clocks based on bosonic atoms. This absence is a direct consequence of fermionic antisymmetry. Resonance shifts proportional to interaction strengths were observed in a three-level system. However, in the strongly interacting regime, these shifts became very small, reflecting the quantum unitarity limit and many-body effects. This insight into an interacting Fermi gas is relevant for the quest to observe superfluidity in this system.},

  Abstract                 = {The phenomenon of matter-wave interference lies at the heart of quantum physics. It has been observed in various contexts in the limit of non-interacting particles as a single-particle effect. Here we observe and control matter-wave interference whose evolution is driven by interparticle interactions. In a multi-path matter-wave interferometer, the macroscopic many-body wave function of an interacting atomic Bose–Einstein condensate develops a regular interference pattern, allowing us to detect and directly visualize the effect of interaction-induced phase shifts. We demonstrate control over the phase evolution by inhibiting interaction-induced dephasing and by refocusing a dephased macroscopic matter wave in a spin-echo-type experiment. Our results show that interactions in a many-body system lead to a surprisingly coherent evolution, possibly enabling narrow-band and high-brightness matter-wave interferometers based on atom lasers.},

  Abstract                 = {Molecular autoionization (MAI) is a Penning-like process involving high Rydberg state electrons from two neighbouring excited atoms and can be the dominant mode of free electron production in a cold excited gas. The density of a gas may be determined employing the sensitivity of MAI to the average inter-ionic separation R N . We show by explicit calculation that a sharp correlation exists between the gas density and Rydberg state quantum number n , manifested through an abrupt increase in the number of ejected electrons as n is increased to a critical value n th = R N 1/2 /2. The MAI electrons have discrete energies allowed by energy conservation, at 6/ n 4 Ry, 2/ n 3 Ry, 4/ n 3  Ry, and so on.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a simple technique for studying the collisions of ultracold atoms in the presence of a magnetic field and radiofrequency (rf) radiation. Resonant control of scattering properties can be achieved by using rf to couple a colliding pair of atoms to a bound state. We show, using the example of 6 Li, that in some ranges of rf frequency and magnetic field this can be done without giving rise to losses. We also show that halo molecules of large spatial extent allow resonant control with much less rf power than deeply bound states. Another way to exert resonant control is with a set of rf-coupled bound states, linked to the colliding pair through the molecular interactions that give rise to magnetically tunable Feshbach resonances. This was recently demonstrated for 87 Rb (Kaufman et al 2009 Phys. Rev. A 80 050701)Â [1]. We examine the underlying atomic and molecular physics that made this possible. Lastly, we consider the control that may be exerted over atomic collisions by placing atoms in superpositions of Zeeman states, and suggest that it could be useful where small changes in scattering length are required. We suggest other species for which rf and magnetic field control could together provide a useful tuning mechanism.},

The ability to separate the molecules from the atoms permits direct imaging of the pure molecular sample. Magnetic levitation enables study of the dynamics of the ensemble on extended time scales. We measured ultralow expansion energies in the range of a few nanokelvin for a sample of 3000 molecules. Our observations are consistent with the presence of a macroscopic molecular matter wave.},

Ultracold collisions have much greater sensitivity to entrance channel interactions{,} so offer the prospect of tuning by external fields to control onset of reaction. However{,} for ultracold collisions{,} kinematic constraints impose severe limitations on the observable dynamical properties. In the exit channel for appreciably exoergic reactions{,} the deBroglie wavelengths become short{,} so the exit dynamics are much like those for warm collisions. Reactions of alkali dimers{,} halides{,} and monoxide molecules are discussed that seem especially congenial for cold collision studies.},

  Abstract                 = {Thermodynamic properties of matter generally depend on the details of interactions between its constituent parts. However, in a unitary Fermi gas where the scattering length diverges, thermodynamics is determined through universal functions that depend only on the particle density and temperature. By using only the general form of the equation of state and the equation of force balance, we measured the local internal energy of the trapped gas as a function of these parameters. Other universal functions, such as those corresponding to the Helmholtz free energy, chemical potential, and entropy, were calculated through general thermodynamic relations. The critical parameters were also determined at the superfluid transition temperature. These results apply to all strongly interacting fermionic systems, including neutron stars and nuclear matter.},

We use spectroscopic measurements to modify the scattering properties near magnetic Fano–Feshbach resonances with a radio-frequency (RF) field by measuring the loss profile versus magnetic field. This work provides the high accuracy locations of ground molecular states near the s-wave Fano–Feshbach resonance, which can be used to study the crossover regime from a Bose–Einstein condensate to a Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer superfluid in the presence of an RF field.},

We determine the static structure factor and report the results on weakly interacting 2D Bose gases, as well as strongly interacting gases in a 2D optical lattice. In the strongly interacting regime, we observe a strong suppression of the static structure factor at long wavelengths.},

Molecular BoseÃ¢â‚¬â€œEinstein condensation of long-range states of both boson dimers and fermion dimers was achieved in 2002Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2003. Condensates of boson dimers were found to be short-lived, but long-lived condensates of fermion dimers have been produced. Signatures of triatomic and tetraatomic molecules have recently been observed. Both homonuclear and heteronuclear molecules have been formed by photoassociation, mostly in very high vibrational levels. Recent attempts to produce ultracold molecules in short-range states (low vibrational levels) are described. Experimental and theoretical work on collisions of ultracold molecules is discussed.

Once formed, the molecules may undergo elastic, inelastic and reactive collisions. Inelastic and reactive collisions are particularly important because they release kinetic energy and eject atoms and molecules from the trap. The theory needed to handle such collisions is presented and recent quantum dynamics calculations on ultracold atomÃ¢â‚¬â€œdiatom collisions of spin-polarized LiÃ¢â‚¬â€°+Ã¢â‚¬â€°Li2, NaÃ¢â‚¬â€°+Ã¢â‚¬â€°Na2 and KÃ¢â‚¬â€°+Ã¢â‚¬â€°K2 are described. All these systems have potential energy surfaces on which barrierless atom exchange reactions can occur, and both inelastic and reactive rates are very fast (typically k inelÃ¢â‚¬â€°>Ã¢â‚¬â€°10-10Ã¢â‚¬â€°cm3Ã¢â‚¬â€°sÃ¢Ë†â€™1 in the Wigner regime). },

  Abstract                 = {We study the classical dynamics of a polar diatomic molecule in the presence of a strong static homogeneous electric field. Our full rovibrational investigation includes the interaction with the field due to the permanent electric dipole moment and the polarizability of the molecule. Using the LiCs molecule as a prototype, we explore the stability of the equilibrium points and their bifurcations as the field strength is increased. The phase space structure and its dependence on the energy and field strength are analyzed in detail. We demonstrate that depending on the field strength and on the energy, the phase space is characterized either by regular features or by small stochastic layers of chaotic motion.},

A molecule is excited from its ground state of energy E0 to thc excited state of Ee by the absorption of one photon of frequency given by the Bohr's condition (hÃ�â€°=Ee-E0). The reverse transition is accompanied by the emission of one photon of the same frcquency. Therefore, the molecular state energies can be directly obtained by the photon encrgies absorbed or emitted. Infrared, microwave, electronic absorption, and emission spectroscopies belong to this category of oneÃ¢â‚¬â€œphoton spectroscopy. },

We produce a BEC in three main steps: loading of the crossed dipole trap from laser-cooled atoms, an intermediate evaporative cooling stage that results in efficient loading of the auxiliary dT, and a final evaporative cooling stage in the dT. Our protocol is implemented in a compact setup and allows us to reach quantum degeneracy even with relatively modest initial atom numbers and available laser power.},

For weakly bound Borromean systems approaching the limit of binding we show that the size-binding energy relation is an almost universal function of the three s -wave scattering lengths measured in units of a hyperradial scaling parameter defined as a mass weighted average of two-body equivalent square well radii. We explain why three-body halos follow this curve and why systems appearing above reveal two-body substructures. Three-body quantum halos 2-3 times larger than the limit set by zero hypermoment are possible.},

By employing a perturbative analysis in an effective field theory well suited to this scale hierarchy we find that an additional three-body parameter is required for consistent renormalization once range corrections are considered. This allows us to extend previously discussed universal relations between different observables in the recombination of cold atoms to account for the presence of a finite effective range. We show that such range corrections allow us to simultaneously describe the positive and negative scattering-length loss features observed in recombination with 7 Li atoms by the Bar-Ilan group. They do not, however, significantly reduce the disagreement between the universal relations and the data of the Rice group on 7 Li recombination at positive and negative scattering lengths.},

  Abstract                 = {The elastic scattering properties in a mixture of sodium and cesium atoms are investigated at cold and ultracold temperatures. Based on the accurate interatomic potential for the NaCs mixture, the interspecies s-wave scattering lengths, the effective ranges and the p-wave scattering lengths are calculated by the quantal method and the semiclassical method, respectively. The s-wave scattering lengths are 512.7 a 0 for the singlet state and 33.4 a 0 for the triplet state. In addition, the spin-change and elastic cross sections are also calculated, and the g-wave shape resonance is found in the total elastic cross sections.},

Here, we study the creation of heteronuclear triatomic molecules in this mixture, and show that a constructive triple-path interference can lead to an almost ideal conversion rate, in comparison with the single- or double-path cases. The important effect of the initial population imbalance on the atomâ€“molecule dark state is also investigated.},

With the value of this parameter known, several three-body properties can be calculated quantitatively, without any other information about the boson-boson interaction. Finite-temperature results for the rate of formation of dimers are found to agree very well with the experimental results. Properties of bound Efimov states and predissociative Efimov resonances are calculated. The lifetime of the predissociative resonances are calculated using the complex coordinate rotation method. For Efimov states confined by an external harmonic potential there are significant changes to both energies and lifetimes if the oscillator length is comparable to or smaller than the two-body scattering length.},

The algorithm is based on the transfer matrix method. This makes it possible to calculate all bound and quasi-bound energy levels and the corresponding wave functions for an arbitrarily shaped potential profile. The results of calculations are compared with those obtained by other authors for various types of problems. A central part of this study deals with solving the Schrodinger equation in quantum-well structures. The results show that the transfer matrix method is as accurate as other methods, but it is easier to implement and, hence, is superior for calculations on small computer, such as a PC},

Although excess electrons bound to such species tend to be very extended spatially and to have little spatial overlap with the valence electrons of the neutral molecules, inclusion of electron correlation effects is essential for quantitatively describing the electron binding. The major electron correlation contribution may be viewed as a dispersion interaction between the excess electron and the electrons of the molecule or cluster. Recent work using a one-electron Drude model to describe excess electrons interacting with polar molecules is reviewed. },

  Abstract                 = {The universal three-body dynamics in ultra-cold binary Fermi and Fermi–Bose mixtures is studied. Two identical fermions of mass m and a particle of mass m 1 with the zero-range two-body interaction in states of total angular momentum L = 1 are considered. Using the boundary condition model for the s -wave interaction of different particles, both eigenvalue and scattering problems are treated by solving hyper-radial equations, whose terms are derived analytically. The dependences of the three-body binding energies on the mass-ratio m / m 1 for the positive two-body scattering length are calculated; it is shown that the ground and excited states arise at m / m 1 ≥ λ 1 ≈ 8.172 60 and m / m 1 ≥ λ 2 ≈ 12.917 43, respectively. For m / m 1 ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} λ 1 and m / m 1 ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} λ 2 , the relevant bound states turn to narrow resonances, whose positions and widths are calculated. The 2 + 1 elastic scattering and the three-body recombination near the three-body threshold are studied, and it is shown that a two-hump structure in the mass-ratio dependences of the cross sections is connected with the rise of the bound states.},

  Abstract                 = {The quantum statistics of atoms is typically observed in the behavior of an ensemble via macroscopic observables. However, quantum statistics modifies the behavior of even two particles. Here, we demonstrate near-complete control over all the internal and external degrees of freedom of two laser-cooled 87Rb atoms trapped in two optical tweezers. This controllability allows us to observe signatures of indistinguishability via two-particle interference. Our work establishes laser-cooled atoms in optical tweezers as a promising route to bottom-up engineering of scalable, low-entropy quantum systems.},

This would allow the first accurate determination of the ionization potential. Particularly suitable resonant intermediate states include the2Ã‚Â 3 ÃŽÂ  ÃŽÂ© ,3Ã‚Â 3 ÃŽÂ£ + and4Ã‚Â 3 ÃŽÂ£ + states, and we report spectroscopic studies of these states. For the2Ã‚Â 3 ÃŽÂ  ÃŽÂ© state, the spinÃ¢â‚¬â€œorbit components (ÃŽÂ© = 0 + , 0 Ã¢Ë†â€™ , 1 and 2) have been investigated and a shallow long-range state (5(0 + )) at ~ 9.3 Ãƒâ€¦ has been observed. We compare our observations of these three states with predictions based on ab initio potential energy curves. Such studies may also permit the direct observation of autoionizing resonances leading to efficient formation of low-lying rovibrational levels of the 2 ÃŽÂ£ + ground state of KRb + , ideally in the v + = 0, N + = 0 level.},

This approach provides a powerful method to identify the vibrational levels of the excited electronic states perturbed globally by neighboring electronic states. This is because the two sets of spectra from the UM and the MB experiments probe the same energy region from very different initial electronic states. The UM experiments utilize high v[prime or minute][prime or minute] levels of the a3[capital Sigma]+ state with large internuclear separations{,} while the MB experiments utilize low v[prime or minute][prime or minute] levels of the ground X1[capital Sigma]+ state with near-equilibrium internuclear separations.

  Abstract                 = {We report the observation of a one-dimensional (1D) Tonks-Girardeau (TG) gas of bosons moving freely in 1D. Although TG gas bosons are strongly interacting, they behave very much like noninteracting fermions. We enter the TG regime with cold rubidium-87 atoms by trapping them with a combination of two light traps. By changing the trap intensities, and hence the atomic interaction strength, the atoms can be made to act either like a Bose-Einstein condensate or like a TG gas. We measure the total 1D energy and the length of the gas. With no free parameters and over a wide range of coupling strengths, our data fit the exact solution for the ground state of a 1D Bose gas.},

  Abstract                 = {The total number of molecules produced in a pulsed photoassociation of ultracold atoms is a crucial link between theory and experiment. A calculation based on first principles can determine the experimental feasibility of a pulsed photoassociation scheme. The calculation method considers an initial thermal ensemble of atoms. This ensemble is first decomposed into a representation of partial spherical waves. The photoassociation dynamics is calculated by solving the multichannel time-dependent SchrÃƒÂ¶dinger equation on a mapped grid. The molecules are primarily assembled in a finite region of internuclear distances, the 'photoassociation window'. The ensemble average was calculated by adding the contributions from initial scattering states confined to a finite volume. These states are Boltzmann averaged where the partition function is summed numerically. Convergence is obtained for a sufficiently large volume. The results are compared to a thermal averaging procedure based on scaling laws which leads to a single representative initial partial wave which is sufficient to represent the density in the 'photoassociation window'. For completeness a third high-temperature thermal averaging procedure is described which is based on random phase thermal Gaussian initial states. The absolute number of molecules in the two first calculation methods agree to within experimental error for photoassociation with picosecond pulses for a thermal ensemble of rubidium or caesium atoms in ultracold conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {Photoassociation with short laser pulses has been proposed as a technique to create ultracold ground state molecules. A broad-band excitation seems the natural choice to drive the series of excitation and deexcitation steps required to form a molecule in its vibronic ground state from two scattering atoms. First attempts at femtosecond photoassociation were{,} however{,} hampered by the requirement to eliminate the atomic excitation leading to trap depletion. On the other hand{,} molecular levels very close to the atomic transition are to be excited. The broad bandwidth of a femtosecond laser then appears to be rather an obstacle. To overcome the ostensible conflict of driving a narrow transition by a broad-band laser{,} we suggest a two-photon photoassociation scheme. In the weak-field regime{,} a spectral phase pattern can be employed to eliminate the atomic line. When the excitation is carried out by more than one photon{,} different pathways in the field can be interfered constructively or destructively. In the strong-field regime{,} a temporal phase can be applied to control dynamic Stark shifts. The atomic transition is suppressed by choosing a phase which keeps the levels out of resonance. We derive analytical solutions for atomic two-photon dark states in both the weak-field and strong-field regime. Two-photon excitation may thus pave the way toward coherent control of photoassociation. Ultimately{,} the success of such a scheme will depend on the details of the excited electronic states and transition dipole moments. We explore the possibility of two-photon femtosecond photoassociation for alkali and alkaline-earth metal dimers and present a detailed study for the example of calcium.},

Two condensates are prepared in a double-well trap and, after release from this trap, overlap in expansion. We detect a clear interference pattern that unambiguously demonstrates the de Broglie wavelength of molecules. We verify that only the condensate fraction shows interference. With increasing interaction strength, the pattern vanishes because elastic collisions during overlap remove particles from the condensate wave function. For strong interaction, the condensates do not penetrate each other as they collide hydrodynamically.},

The association reaction O + H Ã¢â€ â€™ OH(ÃŽÂ½) is simulated by representative wavepackets. The OH molecule to be formed is modeled as a non-rotating Morse oscillator. It is shown that the initial free continuum state of O + H can be transferred selectively into a specified vibrational bound state by interaction with an infrared laser pulse. Optimal design of the laser control field leads to high association probability with very high vibrational state selectivity.},

  Abstract                 = {Progress in ultracold experiments with polar molecules requires a clear understanding of their interactions and reactivity at ultralow collisional energies. Two important theoretical steps in this process are the characterization of interaction potentials between molecules and the modeling of the reactive scattering mechanism. Here, we report on the ab initio calculation of isotropic and anisotropic van der Waals interaction potentials for polar KRb and RbCs colliding with each other or with ultracold atoms. Based on these potentials and two short-range scattering parameters, we then develop a single-channel scattering model with flexible boundary conditions. Our calculations show that, at low temperatures (and in the absence of an external electric field), the reaction rates between molecules or between molecules and atoms have a resonant character as a function of the short-range parameters. We also find that both the isotropic and anisotropic van der Waals coefficients have significant contributions from dipole coupling to excited electronic states. Their values can differ dramatically from those solely obtained from the permanent dipole moment. A comparison with recently obtained reaction rates of fermionic 40 K 87 Rb shows that the experimental data cannot be explained by a model where the short-range scattering parameters are independent of the relative orbital angular momentum or partial wave.},

  Abstract                 = {Discussion of the parity violation and the break of the time-reversal invariance in diatomic molecules has continued for a number of years. Experiments on the TlF molecule gave one of the most stringent limits on the electric-dipole moment of the proton and on the T-violating nuclear forces. At present, a new generation of experiments with paramagnetic diatomic molecules is underway. These experiments are aimed mainly at the search for the electric-dipole moment of the electron. In this topical review we examine theoretical aspects of parity non-conservation in diatomic molecules. We focus on molecular theory leaving aside the nuclear part of the problem. In this approach the nucleus is characterized by the number of P-odd and P,T-odd moments, namely anapole moment, Schiff moment and magnetic quadrupole moment. Molecular theory has to link these moments to the experimentally measured quantities, such as frequency shifts, etc. The other possible sources of the parity non-conservation in molecules are the electron-nuclear neutral current interactions and the electric-dipole moment of the electron. They are also discussed in this review.},

The molecules are formed in a two-species magneto-optical trap and detected by two-photon ionization and time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The production rate coefficient is found to be in the range 10 ?18 cm 3 s ?1 to 10 ?16 cm 3 s ?1 , at least an order of magnitude smaller than for other heteronuclear diatomic molecules directly formed in a magneto-optical trap.},

The creation of ultracold molecules may allow for spectroscopy measurements with extremely high precision and tests of fundamental symmetries of nature, quantum computation with molecules as qubits, and controlled chemistry. The probability of chemical reactions and collisional energy transfer can be very large at temperatures near zero kelvin. The collision energy of ultracold atoms and molecules is much smaller than perturbations due to interactions with external electric or magnetic fields available in the laboratory. External fields may therefore be used to induce dissociation of weakly bound molecules, stimulate forbidden electronic transitions, suppress the effect of centrifugal barriers in outgoing reaction channels or tune Feshbach resonances that enhance chemical reactivity.},

Three helium (He) atoms have been predicted to form a molecular system that manifests this peculiarity under natural conditions without artificial tuning of the attraction between particles by an external field. Here we report experimental observation of this long-predicted but experimentally elusive Efimov state of 4He3 by means of Coulomb explosion imaging. We show spatial images of an Efimov state, confirming the predicted size and a typical structure where two atoms are close to each other while the third is far away.},

  Abstract                 = {We develop a theoretical description of photoassociative stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) near a Feshbach resonance in a thermal atomic gas. We show that it is possible to use low-intensity laser pulses to directly excite pairs of atoms in the continuum near a Feshbach resonance and to transfer most of the atomic cloud to the lowest rovibrational level of the molecular ground state. For a broad resonance, commonly found in several mixtures of alkali atoms, our model predicts a transfer efficiency up to 97% for a given atom pair, and up to 70% when averaged over an atomic ensemble. The laser intensities and pulse durations needed for such an optimal transfer, 10 2 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ10 3 W cm Ã¢Ë†â€™2 and several microseconds, are easily achievable experimentally. A single pair of STIRAP pulses converts an estimated fraction f ~10 Ã¢Ë†â€™6 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ10 Ã¢Ë†â€™4 of atoms in an atomic ensemble, leading to the production of 10Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1000 molecules in a large sample of 10 7 atoms. A total of ~10 4 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ10 6 pulse pairs are thus required to transfer most atoms into molecules. Such an efficiency compares with or surpasses currently available techniques for creating stable diatomic molecules, and the versatility of this approach simplifies its potential use for many molecular species.},

  Abstract                 = {Quantum phenomena in the translational motion of reactants, which are usually negligible at room temperature, can dominate reaction dynamics at low temperatures. In such cold conditions, even the weak centrifugal force is enough to create a potential barrier that keeps reactants separated. However, reactions may still proceed through tunnelling because, at low temperatures, wave-like properties become important. At certain de Broglie wavelengths, the colliding particles can become trapped in long-lived metastable scattering states, leading to sharp increases in the total reaction rate. Here, we show that these metastable states are responsible for a dramatic, order-of-magnitude-strong, quantum kinetic isotope effect by measuring the absolute Penning ionization reaction rates between hydrogen isotopologues and metastable helium down to 0.01 K. We demonstrate that measurements of a single isotope are insufficient to constrain ab initio calculations, making the kinetic isotope effect in the cold regime necessary to remove ambiguity among possible potential energy surfaces.},

  Abstract                 = {We investigate theoretically the long-range electrostatic interactions between a ground-state homonuclear alkali-metal dimer and an excited alkali-metal atom taking into account its fine-structure. The interaction involves the combination of first-order quadrupole-quadrupole and second-order dipole-dipole effects. Depending on the considered species{,} the atomic spin-orbit may be comparable to the atom-molecule electrostatic energy and to the dimer rotational structure. Here we extend our general description in the framework of the second-order degenerate perturbation theory [M. Lepers and O. Dulieu{,} Eur. Phys. J. D{,} 2011] to various regimes induced by the magnitude of the atomic spin-orbit. A complex dynamics of the atom-molecule may take place at large distances{,} which may have consequences for the search for an universal model of ultracold inelastic collisions as proposed for instance in the study of Z. Idziaszek and P. S. Julienne [Phys. Rev. Lett.104{,} 2010{,} 113202].},

  Abstract                 = {We develop a diagrammatic approach for solving few-body problems in heteronuclear fermionic mixtures near a narrow interspecies Feshbach resonance. We calculate s -, p -, and d -wave phaseshifts for the scattering of an atom by a weakly-bound dimer. The fermionic statistics of atoms and the composite nature of the dimer lead to a strong angular momentum dependence of the atom-dimer interaction, which manifests itself in a peculiar interference of the scattered s - and p -waves. This effect strengthens with the mass ratio and is remarkably pronounced in 40 K-( 40 K- 6 Li) atom-dimer collisions. We calculate the scattering length for two dimers formed near a narrow interspecies resonance. Finally, we discuss the collisional relaxation of the dimers to deeply bound states and evaluate the corresponding rate constant as a function of the detuning and collision energy.},

  Abstract                 = {Translationally cold caesium molecules are created by photoassociation below the 6s + 6p1/2 excited state and selectively detected by resonance enhanced two photon ionization (RE2PI). A series of excited vibrational levels belonging to the 0-g symmetry is identified. The regular progression of the vibrational spacings and of the rotational constants of the 0-g (6s + 6p1/2) levels is strongly altered in two energy domains. These deviations are interpreted in terms of resonant coupling with deeply bound energy levels of two upper 0-g states dissociating into the 6s + 6p3/2 and 6s + 5d3/2 asymptotes. A theoretical model is proposed to explain the coupling and a quantum defect analysis of the perturbed level position is performed. Moreover{,} the resonant coupling changes dramatically the spontaneous decay products of the photoexcited molecules{,} strongly enhancing the decay into deeply bound levels of the a3[capital Sigma]+u triplet state and of the X1[capital Sigma]+g ground state. These results may be relevant when conceiving population transferring schemes in cold molecule systems.},

  Abstract                 = {Developments in the application of hyperspherical coordinates in a unified treatment of bound states and resonances of two-electron atomic systems and other general Coulomb three-body systems are reviewed. It is shown that the nature of the internal normal modes of such three-body systems can be examined within the adiabatic approximation where the hyperradius is treated as an adiabatic parameter. From the nodal lines in the internal coordinates, it is shown how a set of new quantum numbers can be assigned. The most recent progress in the application of hyperspherical close coupling method to the photoabsorption of two-electron atoms and to rearrangement collisions is also addressed. },

This article reviews recent progress in this area. Particular emphasis is placed on some intriguing physical phenomena associated with a few benchmark reactions and how these measurements help in answering fundamental questions about reaction dynamics. We examine specifically the geometric phase effects in the reaction H + D2, the dynamical resonance phenomenon in F + HD, the unusually large spin-orbit reactivity in Cl(2P) + H2, the insertion reaction O(1D) + H2, and the mode-specific reactivity in Cl + CH4(Î½). The give-and-take between experiment and theory in unraveling the physical picture of the dynamics is illustrated throughout this review. },

  Abstract                 = {Photoassociation of ultracold atoms induced by chirped picosecond pulses is analyzed in a non-perturbative treatment by following the wavepacket dynamics on the ground and excited surfaces. The initial state is described by a Boltzmann distribution of stationary continuum states. The chosen example is photoassociation of cesium atoms at temperature $T = 54 \mu$ K from the $a^3 \Sigma_u^ + (6s,6s)$ continuum to bound levels in the external well of the 0 g - (6 s + 6 p 3/2 ) potential. We study how the modification of the pulse characteristics (carrier frequency, duration, linear chirp rate and intensity) can enhance the number of photoassociated molecules and suggest ways of optimizing the production of stable molecules.},

The results of the numerical simulation are compared to our experimental observations of evaporative cooling of magnetically trapped 133 Cs atoms in the F = 3, m F = âˆ’3 state. The simulation accurately reproduces our experimental performance and indicates that the reduction in cooling efficiency as the gas enters the hydrodynamic regime is the main obstacle to the realization of Boseâ€“Einstein condensation (BEC) in this state. The simulation is used to explore alternative routes to BEC.},

For each Rydberg series a `potential' in R is obtained, and the properties of the autoionizing states follow from the shape of the `potentials'.

Efimov showed that when the scattering length was effectively infinite, i.e. much larger than the natural length scale of the atoms, a large number of three-body bound states could form even when the two-body system supported only one weakly bound state, or possibly none at all. The states are bound in an effective 1/ R 2 potential and therefore form a series with a characteristic energy spacing. These states are called Efimov states and are conceptually important since they indicate a new way to form aggregates of particles. They bear some relation to vibrationally bound states of three atoms. The theory of these states and their relation to vibrational binding is reviewed in light of recent experimental measurements.},

  Abstract                 = {We have developed a model for calculating saturated absorption spectra for dipole transitions in multi-level atoms. Using a semiclassical density matrix formalism, we derive a set of coupled differential equations for the internal state of the atom in a standing wave light field. The equations are solved using standard integration techniques. The absorption at each laser detuning is found from an average of the absorption for a number of velocities along the laser field, thermally weighted. The method is relatively efficient computationally yet quantitatively predicts important details of saturated absorption spectra including saturation, crossover resonances, merging of absorption lines at high intensity and optical pumping between hyperfine levels. We have measured saturated absorption and fluorescence spectra of 85 Rb, and compare to our computational results for a 36-level model.},

  Abstract                 = {Ultrashort laser pulses have thus far been used in two distinct modes. In the time domain, the pulses have allowed probing and manipulation of dynamics on a subpicosecond time scale. More recently, phase stabilization has produced optical frequency combs with absolute frequency reference across a broad bandwidth. Here we combine these two applications in a spectroscopic study of rubidium atoms. A wide-bandwidth, phase-stabilized femtosecond laser is used to monitor the real-time dynamic evolution of population transfer. Coherent pulse accumulation and quantum interference effects are observed and well modeled by theory. At the same time, the narrow linewidth of individual comb lines permits a precise and efficient determination of the global energy-level structure, providing a direct connection among the optical, terahertz, and radio-frequency domains. The mechanical action of the optical frequency comb on the atomic sample is explored and controlled, leading to precision spectroscopy with an appreciable reduction in systematic errors.},

This approach allows for a straightforward interpretation of the field properties, as the control field is constructed from the dynamics of the system.

The corresponding fields are analysed and it is shown that their time dependence can be understood in every respect.},

  Abstract                 = {We report modulation transfer spectroscopy on the D2 transitions in 85 Rb and 87 Rb using a simple home-built electro-optic modulator (EOM). We show that both the gradient and amplitude of modulation transfer spectroscopy signals, for the 87 Rb F = 2 ? F ' = 3 and the 85 Rb F = 3 ? F ' = 4 transitions, can be significantly enhanced by expanding the beams, improving the signals for laser frequency stabilization. The signal gradient for these transitions is increased by a factor of 3 and the peak to peak amplitude was increased by a factor of 2. The modulation transfer signal for the 85 Rb F = 2 ? F ' transitions is also presented to highlight how this technique can generate a single, clear line for laser frequency stabilization even in cases where there are a number of closely spaced hyperfine transitions.},

  Abstract                 = {Optical lattices have emerged as ideal simulators for Hubbard models of strongly correlated materials, such as the high-temperature superconducting cuprates. In optical lattice experiments, microscopic parameters such as the interaction strength between particles are well known and easily tunable. Unfortunately, this benefit of using optical lattices to study Hubbard models comes with one clear disadvantage: the energy scales in atomic systems are typically nanokelvin compared with kelvin in solids, with a correspondingly miniscule temperature scale required to observe exotic phases such as d -wave superconductivity. The ultra-low temperatures necessary to reach the regime in which optical lattice simulation can have an impact—the domain in which our theoretical understanding fails—have been a barrier to progress in this field. To move forward, a concerted effort is required to develop new techniques for cooling and, by extension, techniques to measure even lower temperatures. This paper will be devoted to discussing the concepts of cooling and thermometry, fundamental sources of heat in optical lattice experiments, and a review of proposed and implemented thermometry and cooling techniques.},

  Abstract                 = {We show that continuous-wave, two colour excitation of three-level atoms opens new channels of irreversible population transfer between atomic levels. This process, which we describe as dynamically induced irreversibility, leads to unanticipated phenomena including the inversion of atomic transitions whose upper atomic level has no conventional source of irreversible population pumping. We also study the effect of excitation-field bandwidth on the gain exhibited by driven, three-level, V-type atomic systems. Gain, which may or may not be inversionless in the atomic-state basis, is produced through strong monochromatic driving of one atomic transition and weaker pumping of a coupled transition. It is found that monochromatic pumping frequently yields greater optical gain than incoherent (wide bandwidth) pumping. This is particularly true when system gain can be attributed to hidden inversions among the eigenstates (semi-classical dressed states) of the coupled atom+driving field quantum system. Last, we report the observation of continuous-wave lasing in a strongly driven barium cascade system and interpret its properties in terms of the models presented.},

In a Stark decelerator, this is exploited to accelerate, transport, or decelerate a fraction of a molecular beam. When combined with a trap, the decelerator provides a means to store the molecules for times up to seconds. Here, we review our efforts to produce cold molecules via this technique. In particular, we present a new generation Stark decelerator and electrostatic trap that selects a significant part of a molecular beam pulse that can be loaded into the trap. Deceleration and trapping experiments using a beam of OH radicals are discussed. },

  Abstract                 = {Quantum tunneling is at the heart of many low-temperature phenomena. In strongly correlated lattice systems, tunneling is responsible for inducing effective interactions, and long-range tunneling substantially alters many-body properties in and out of equilibrium. We observe resonantly enhanced long-range quantum tunneling in one-dimensional Mott-insulating Hubbard chains that are suddenly quenched into a tilted configuration. Higher-order tunneling processes over up to five lattice sites are observed as resonances in the number of doubly occupied sites when the tilt per site is tuned to integer fractions of the Mott gap. This forms a basis for a controlled study of many-body dynamics driven by higher-order tunneling and demonstrates that when some degrees of freedom are frozen out, phenomena that are driven by small-amplitude tunneling terms can still be observed.},

The experimental techniques and results are presented and reviewed. The molecule production rates are compared among themselves as well as with existing theories. We conclude that theoretical and experimental improvements are necessary to help plan new experiments. The experimental results indicate that KRb and RbCs are the best systems for heteronuclear molecule production.},

  Abstract                 = {Ultracold polar molecules, with their long-range electric dipolar interactions, offer a unique platform for studying correlated quantum many-body phenomena. However, realizing a highly degenerate quantum gas of molecules with a low entropy per particle is challenging. We report the synthesis of a low-entropy quantum gas of potassium-rubidium molecules (KRb) in a three-dimensional optical lattice. We simultaneously load into the optical lattice a Mott insulator of bosonic Rb atoms and a single-band insulator of fermionic K atoms. Then, using magnetoassociation and optical state transfer, we efficiently produce ground-state molecules in the lattice at those sites that contain one Rb and one K atom. The achieved filling fraction of 25% should enable future studies of transport and entanglement propagation in a many-body system with long-range dipolar interactions.},

Using two-photon photoassociation spectroscopy in a laser-cooled mixture of 176Yb and 87Rb we are able to determine the binding energies of weakly-bound vibrational levels. By applying the LeRoy-Bernstein method we assign the vibrational quantum numbers and deduce a C6 coefficient for the long-range part of the molecular potential of [similar]2500 a.u.},

  Abstract                 = {We produce an ultracold and dense sample of rovibronic ground state Cs 2 molecules close to the regime of quantum degeneracy, in a single hyperfine level, in the presence of an optical lattice. The molecules are individually trapped, in the motional ground state of an optical lattice well, with a lifetime of 8 s. For preparation, we start with a zero-temperature atomic Mott-insulator state with optimized double-site occupancy and efficiently associate weakly-bound dimer molecules on a Feshbach resonance. Despite extremely weak Franck-Condon wavefunction overlap, the molecules are subsequently transferred with >50% efficiency to the rovibronic ground state by a stimulated four-photon process. Our results present a crucial step towards the generation of Bose-Einstein condensates of ground-state molecules and, when suitably generalized to polar heteronuclear molecules such as RbCs, the realization of dipolar many-body quantum-gas phases in periodic potentials.},

  Abstract                 = {We analyse the recent experiments investigating the low-energy physics of three lithium 6 atoms in three different internal states with resonant two-body scattering lengths. All observed features are qualitatively consistent with the expected Efimov effect, i.e. the effective universal three-body attraction that arises for large values of the scattering lengths. However, we find that a quantitative description at negative energy requires non-universal two- and three-body corrections due to presently unknown behaviour at short distance. An attempt to implement these corrections is made through energy-dependent parameters that are fitted to the experimental data.},

An efficient numerical procedure is described. The large-distance asymptotic behaviour, crucial for weakly bound three-body systems, is described almost analytically for arbitrary potentials. The Efimov effect is especially considered. The geometric structures of the bound states are quantitatively investigated. The accuracy of the schematic models and previous computations is comparable, i.e. within 20% for the spatially extended states and within 40% for the smaller ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0953-4075/31/18/008/img1.gif] -trimer ground state.},

  Abstract                 = {When two particles attract via a resonant short-range interaction, three particles always form an infinite tower of bound states characterized by a discrete scaling symmetry. It has been considered that this Efimov effect exists only in three dimensions. Here we review how the Efimov physics can be liberated from three dimensions by considering two-body and three-body interactions in mixed dimensions and four-body interaction in one dimension. In such new systems, intriguing phenomena appear, such as confinement-induced Efimov effect, Bose–Fermi crossover in Efimov spectrum, and formation of interlayer Efimov trimers. Some of them are observable in ultracold atom experiments and we believe that this study significantly broadens our horizons of universal Efimov physics.},

  Abstract                 = {We review the progress in controlling quantum dynamical processes in the condensed phase with femtosecond laser pulses. Due to its high particle density the condensed phase has both high relevance and appeal for chemical synthesis. Thus{,} in recent years different methods have been developed to manipulate the dynamics of condensed-phase systems by changing one or multiple laser pulse parameters. Single-parameter control is often achieved by variation of the excitation pulse{'}s wavelength{,} its linear chirp or its temporal subpulse separation in case of pulse sequences. Multiparameter control schemes are more flexible and provide a much larger parameter space for an optimal solution. This is realized in adaptive femtosecond quantum control{,} in which the optimal solution is iteratively obtained through the combination of an experimental feedback signal and an automated learning algorithm. Several experiments are presented that illustrate the different control concepts and highlight their broad applicability. These fascinating achievements show the continuous progress on the way towards the control of complex quantum reactions in the condensed phase.},

Fermionic lithium-6 atoms in an optical trap are evaporatively cooled to degeneracy using a magnetic field to induce strong, resonant interactions. Upon abruptly releasing the cloud from the trap, the gas is observed to expand rapidly in the transverse direction while remaining nearly stationary in the axial direction. We interpret the expansion dynamics in terms of collisionless superfluid and collisional hydrodynamics. For the data taken at the longest evaporation times, we find that collisional hydrodynamics does not provide a satisfactory explanation, whereas superfluidity is plausible.},

WPI is a fundamental and versatile scenario used to control a variety of quantum systems with a sequence of short laser pulses whose relative phase is finely adjusted to control the interference of electronic or nuclear wave packets (WPs). It is also useful in retrieving quantum information such as the amplitudes and phases of eigenfunctions superposed to generate a WP. Experimental and theoretical efforts to retrieve both the amplitude and phase information are recounted. This review also discusses information processing based on the eigenfunctions of atoms and molecules as one of the modern and future applications of coherent control. The ultrafast coherent control of ultracold atoms and molecules and the coherent control of complex systems are briefly discussed as future perspectives. },

We consider a situation where polar molecules form a self-assembled dipolar lattice, in which atoms or molecules of a second species can move and scatter. We describe the system dynamics in a master equation approach in the Brownian motion limit of slow particles and fast phonons, which we find appropriate for our system. In a wide regime of parameters, the reduced dynamics of the particles leads to physical realizations of extended Hubbard models with tuneable long-range interactions mediated by crystal phonons.

  Abstract                 = {In this PhD tutorial, we present experiments with quantum degenerate mixtures of fermionic and bosonic atoms in three-dimensional optical lattices. This heteronuclear quantum gas mixture offers a wide range of possibilities for quantum simulation, implementation of condensed matter Hamiltonians, quantum chemistry and ultimately dense and quantum degenerate dipolar molecular samples. We show how quantum degenerate mixtures of 40 K and 87 Rb are created in the experiment. We analyse stages of evaporative cooling and show how a dynamic mean-field collapse occurs during the final stage of the evaporation (Ospelkaus et al 2006 Phys. Rev. Lett. 96 020401) as a result of attractive interactions. The particle numbers observed in our experiment have only been limited by this mean-field collapse, resulting in an excellent starting point for our experiments. We explore magnetic-field-induced Feshbach resonances and demonstrate tuning of interactions (Ospelkaus et al 2006 Phys. Rev. Lett. 97 120403) between 40 K and 87 Rb by means of heteronuclear Feshbach resonances. We observe both stable attractively and repulsively interacting mixtures. We analyse the mean-field energy of the condensate and find qualitative agreement with a simple model. By making the interaction strong and attractive, we induce a mean-field collapse of the mixture. For strong and repulsive interactions, we observe phase separation of the mixture. When loaded into a 3D optical lattice, a whole zoo of novel quantum phases has been predicted for Fermiâ€“Bose mixtures. We present the first realization of Fermiâ€“Bose mixtures in 3D optical lattices as a novel quantum many-body system (Ospelkaus et al 2006 Phys. Rev. Lett. 96 180403). We study the phase coherence of the bosonic cloud in the 3D optical lattice as a function of the amount of fermionic atoms simultaneously trapped in the lattice. We observe a loss of phase coherence at much lower lattice depth than for a pure bosonic cloud and discuss possible theoretical scenarios including adiabatic processes, mean-field Fermiâ€“Boseâ€“Hubbard scenarios and disorder-enhanced localization scenarios. After considering this many-body limit of mixtures in lattices, we show how fermionic heteronuclear Feshbach molecules can be created in the optical lattice (Ospelkaus et al 2006 Phys. Rev. Lett. 97 120402) as a crucial step towards all ground-state dense dipolar molecular samples. We develop rf association as a novel molecule association technique, measure the binding energy, lifetime and association efficiency of the molecules. We develop a simple theoretical single-channel model of the molecules trapped in the lattice (Deuretzbacher et al 2008 Phys. Rev. A 77 032726) which gives an excellent quantitative agreement with the experimental data.},

  Abstract                 = {We report the creation and characterization of a near quantum-degenerate gas of polar 40K-87Rb molecules in their absolute rovibrational ground state. Starting from weakly bound heteronuclear KRb Feshbach molecules{,} we implement precise control of the molecular electronic{,} vibrational{,} and rotational degrees of freedom with phase-coherent laser fields. In particular{,} we coherently transfer these weakly bound molecules across a 125 THz frequency gap in a single step into the absolute rovibrational ground state of the electronic ground potential. Phase coherence between lasers involved in the transfer process is ensured by referencing the lasers to two single components of a phase-stabilized optical frequency comb. Using these methods{,} we prepare a dense gas of 4 [times] 104 polar molecules at a temperature below 400 nK. This fermionic molecular ensemble is close to quantum degeneracy and can be characterized by a degeneracy parameter of T/TF = 3. We have measured the molecular polarizability in an optical dipole trap where the trap lifetime gives clues to interesting decay mechanisms. Given the large measured dipole moment of the KRb molecules of 0.5 Debye{,} the study of quantum degenerate molecular gases interacting via strong dipolar interactions is now within experimental reach.

  Abstract                 = {We report the observation of pairing in a gas of atomic fermions with unequal numbers of two components. Beyond a critical polarization, the gas separates into a phase that is consistent with a superfluid paired core surrounded by a shell of normal unpaired fermions. The critical polarization diminishes with decreasing attractive interaction. For near-zero polarization, we measured the parameter β = {\textendash}0.54 {\textpm} 0.05, describing the universal energy of a strongly interacting paired Fermi gas, and found good agreement with recent theory. These results are relevant to predictions of exotic new phases of quark matter and of strongly magnetized superconductors.},

  Abstract                 = {A planetary atom is an atom or ion in a state, with two or more excited electrons, which has negligible overlap with the ground state or first few excited states. Classical mechanics and Einstein-Brillouin-Keller quantization are used to study them. They are not produced by direct (one-photon) optical excitation from low states, statistically they predominate over states which can be produced by direct optical excitation, and they are long-lived. Each state is a member of a series labelled by a half-odd-integer scaling number $\nu $. The states of the series have energies which are approximately proportional to $1/\nu ^{2}$. The energies of the states of a planetary atom depend on the charge of the parent ion, and not on its detailed structure. Electron energy loss spectroscopy is a possible means of studying planetary atoms experimentally.},

  Abstract                 = {We give a brief overview of recent studies of weakly bound homonuclear molecules in ultracold two-component Fermi gases. It is emphasized that they represent novel composite bosons, which exhibit features of Fermi statistics at short intermolecular distances. In particular, the Pauli exclusion principle for identical fermionic atoms provides a strong suppression of collisional relaxation of such molecules into deep bound states. We then analyse heteronuclear molecules which are expected to be formed in mixtures of different fermionic atoms. We show how an increase in the mass ratio for the constituent atoms changes the physics of collisional stability of such molecules compared to homonuclear ones. We discuss Bose–Einstein condensation of these composite bosons and consider prospects for future studies.},

While such behaviour is characteristic of the long-range molecules{,} the photoassociation of bound molecules is confirmed in additional experiments. The pump-probe signal observed on a 250 ps time scale did not{,} however{,} reveal wavepacket oscillations predicted by theory. This result is discussed using numerical simulations of photoassociation and a modification to the current experiments that could lead to the detection of wavepacket dynamics is suggested.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a simple method for calculating the binary collision rate between atoms in near-resonant optical lattices. The method is based on Monte Carlo wave-function simulations, and the collision rate is obtained by monitoring the quantum flux beyond the average distance between the atoms. To illustrate the usefulness of the method, we calculate the collision rates for a wide range of occupation densities and various modulation depths of the lattice. The method presented here, combined with the semiclassical calculations accounting for intrawell collisions, can simplify the study of the effects of binary collisions on the dynamics of atomic clouds trapped in near-resonant optical lattices.},

  Abstract                 = {We present an exhaustive analysis of the light-induced frequency shifts of the photoassociation lines of ultracold metastable 4 He* atoms in a magnetic trap. The measurements of the shifts of several vibrational levels bound in the purely long-range J = 1, 0 u + potential linked to the 2 3 S 1 –2 3 P 0 asymptote were reported in a previous paper (Kim et al 2005 Europhys. Lett. 72 548), and are analysed here. The simplicity of this system makes it very appropriate for a detailed study. Indeed, the purely long-range character of the excited potential allows one to calculate exact excited molecular wavefunctions and to use asymptotic expansions at large internuclear distances of the ground-state wavefunctions appearing in Franck–Condon-type integrals. Moreover, the number of collisional channels to be considered is strongly reduced by the absence of hyperfine structure for 4 He* and the use of polarized ultracold atoms and polarized light. This allows us to derive semi-analytical expressions for the shifts showing explicitly their linear dependences on the s-wave scattering length a of spin polarized metastable 4 He* atoms. This explains how it is possible to derive the measurement of a from these shifts.},

  Abstract                 = {We theoretically investigate pump-dump photoassociation of ultracold molecules with amplitude- and phase-modulated femtosecond laser pulses. For this purpose, a perturbative model for light-matter interaction is developed and combined with a genetic algorithm for adaptive feedback control of the laser pulse shapes. The model is applied to the formation of 85 Rb 2 molecules in a magneto-optical trap. We find that optimized pulse shapes may maximize the formation of ground state molecules in a specific vibrational state at a pump-dump delay time for which unshaped pulses lead to a minimum of the formation rate. Compared to the maximum formation rate obtained for unshaped pulses at the optimum pump-dump delay, the optimized pulses lead to a significant improvement of about 40% for the target level population. Since our model yields the spectral amplitudes and phases of the optimized pulses, the results are directly applicable in pulse shaping experiments.},

This scheme allows us to completely compensate the intraspecies collisions by tunable interspecies collisions, and thereby achieve a robust atomÃ¢â‚¬â€œmolecule conversion which is equivalent to that in a collision-free case. By taking the formation of stable 41 K 87 Rb molecules as an example, we study the feasibility of the scheme.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose a scheme of 'R-type' photoassociative adiabatic passage (PAP) to create polar molecular condensates from two different species of ultracold atoms. Due to the presence of a quasi-coherent population trapping state in the scheme, it is possible to associate atoms into molecules with a low-power photoassociation (PA) laser. One remarkable advantage of our scheme is that a tunable atomÃ¢â‚¬â€œmolecule coupling strength can be achieved by using a time-dependent PA field, which exhibits larger flexibility than using a tunable magnetic field. In addition, our results show that the PA intensity required in the 'R-type' PAP could be greatly reduced compared to that in a conventional 'ÃŽâ€º-type' one.},

The PA processes via one- and two-photon excitations are described. The calculated results show that the associated molecule can be prepared to a desired rovibrational state of the ground electronic state for NaH.

For an ultracold atom-diatom collision and for a diatomic molecule in its highest vibrational state, inelastic rate coefficients vanish for a system composed of fermionic atoms as the atom-atom scattering length increases whereas they do not for a system composed of bosonicatoms. The differences come from the symmetrization of the wavefunction of the systems. We explain these differences by comparing the shape of the effective potentials of the atom-diatom approach. For the fermionic system, we use a zero-range interaction to modelize the adiabatic energies and we give a lower estimate of the atom-diatom scattering length as a function of the atom-atom scattering length.},

  Abstract                 = {Ultracold atomic gases have proven to be remarkable model systems for exploring quantum mechanical phenomena. Experimental work on gases of fermionic atoms in particular has seen astounding recent progress. In the short span of time between 2001 and 2004 accessible Fermi gas systems evolved from normal Fermi liquids at moderate temperatures to superfluids in the BCS-BEC crossover. This was made possible by unique control over interparticle interactions using Feshbach resonances in 6Li and 40K gases. In this chapter we present the story of the experimental realization of BCS-BEC crossover physics from the point of view of studies using 40K at JILA. We start with some historical context and an introduction to the theory of the BCS-BEC crossover and Feshbach resonances. We then present studies of a normal 40K Fermi gas at a Feshbach resonance and the work required to cool the gas to temperatures where superfluidity in the crossover is predicted. These studies culminated in the first observation of a phase transition in the BCS-BEC crossover regime, a task accomplished through detection of condensation of fermionic atom pairs. We also discuss subsequent work that confirmed the crossover nature of the pairs in these condensates. },

  Abstract                 = {We present the design, implementation and characterization of a dual-species magneto-optical trap (MOT) for fermionic 6 Li and 40 K atoms with large atom numbers. The MOT simultaneously contains 5.2 × 10 9 6 Li-atoms and 8.0 × 10 9 40 K-atoms, which are continuously loaded by a Zeeman slower for 6 Li and a 2D-MOT for 40 K. The atom sources induce capture rates of 1.2 × 10 9 6 Li-atoms/s and 1.4 × 10 9 40 K-atoms/s. Trap losses due to light-induced interspecies collisions of ?65% were observed and could be minimized to ?10% by using low magnetic field gradients and low light powers in the repumping light of both atomic species. The described system represents the starting point for the production of a large-atom number quantum degenerate Fermi-Fermi mixture.},

We performed trap loss spectroscopy within a range of 325 GHz below the Li(2 S 1/2 )+K(4 P 3/2 ) and Li(2 S 1/2 )+K(4 P 1/2 ) asymptotic states and observed more than 60 resonances, which we identify as rovibrational levels of 7 of 8 attractive long-range molecular potentials. The long-range dispersion coefficients and rotational constants are derived. We find large molecule formation rates of up to ~3.5Ãƒâ€”10 7 s Ã¢Ë†â€™ 1 , which are shown to be comparable to those for homonuclear 40 K 2 * . Using a theoretical model we infer decay rates to the deeply bound electronic ground-state vibrational level X 1 ÃŽÂ£ + ( v '=3) of ~5Ãƒâ€”10 4 s Ã¢Ë†â€™1 . Our results pave the way for the production of ultracold bosonic ground-state 6 Li 40 K molecules which exhibit a large intrinsic permanent electric dipole moment.},

  Abstract                 = {The problem of a few interacting fermions in quantum physics has sparked intense interest, particularly in recent years owing to connections with the behaviour of superconductors, fermionic superfluids and finite nuclei. This review addresses recent developments in the theoretical description of four fermions having finite-range interactions, stressing insights that have emerged from a hyperspherical coordinate perspective. The subject is complicated, so we have included many detailed formulae that will hopefully make these methods accessible to others interested in using them. The universality regime, where the dominant length scale in the problem is the two-body scattering length, is particularly stressed, including its implications for the famous BCS–BEC crossover problem. Derivations and relevant formulae are also included for the calculation of challenging few-body processes such as recombination.},

In the photoassociation process{,} formation of a chemical bond is facilitated by light in a free-to-bound optical transition. Here{,} we study free-to-bound photoassociation of a diatomic molecule induced by femtosecond pulses exciting a pair of scattering atoms interacting via the van-der-Waals-type electronic ground state potential into bound levels of an electronically excited state. The thermal gas of reactants is at temperatures in the range of hundreds of degrees. Despite this incoherent initial state{,} rotational and vibrational coherences are observed in the probing of the created Mg2 molecules.},

  Abstract                 = {We review topics of current interest in the physics of electronic, atomic and molecular scattering in the vicinity of thresholds. Starting from phase space arguments, we discuss the modifications of the Wigner law that are required to deal with scattering by Coulomb, dipolar and dispersion potentials, as well as aspects of threshold behaviour observed in ultracold atomic collisions. We employ the tools of quantum defect and semiclassical theories to bring out the rich variety of threshold behaviours. The discussion is then turned to recent progress in understanding threshold behaviour of many-body break-ups into both charged and neutral species, including both Wannier double ionization and three-body recombination in ultracold gases. We emphasize the dominant role that hyperspherical coordinate methods have played in understanding these problems. We assess the effects of external fields on scattering, and the corresponding modification of phase space that alters the Wigner law. Threshold laws in low dimensions and examples of their applications to specific collision processes are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {We describe the ground state of a large, dilute, neutral atom Bose–Einstein condensate (BEC) doped with N strongly coupled mutually indistinguishable, bosonic neutral atoms (referred to as ‘impurity’) in the polaron regime where the BEC density response to the impurity atoms remains significantly smaller than the average density of the surrounding BEC. We find that N impurity atoms with N  1 can self-localize at a lower value of the impurity–boson interaction strength than a single impurity atom. When the ‘bare’ short-range impurity–impurity repulsion does not play a significant role, the self-localization of multiple bosonic impurity atoms into the same single particle orbital (which we call co-self-localization) is the nucleation process of the phase separation transition. When the short-range impurity–impurity repulsion successfully competes with co-self-localization, the system may form a stable liquid of self-localized single impurity polarons.},

  Abstract                 = {Cold molecules promise to reveal a rich set of novel collision dynamics in the low-energy regime. By combining for the first time the techniques of Stark deceleration{,} magnetic trapping{,} and cryogenic buffer gas cooling{,} we present the first experimental observation of cold collisions between two different species of state-selected neutral polar molecules. This has enabled an absolute measurement of the total trap loss cross sections between OH and ND3 at a mean collision energy of 3.6 cm-1 (5 K). Due to the dipolar interaction{,} the total cross section increases upon application of an external polarizing electric field. Cross sections computed from ab initio potential energy surfaces are in agreement with the measured value at zero external electric field. The theory presented here represents the first such analysis of collisions between a 2[capital Pi] radical and a closed-shell polyatomic molecule.},

  Abstract                 = {Shear viscosity is a measure of the amount of dissipation in a simple fluid. In kinetic theory shear viscosity is related to the rate of momentum transport by quasi-particles, and the uncertainty relation suggests that the ratio of shear viscosity Î· to entropy density s in units of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/planck.gif] {planck} / k B is bounded by a constant. Here, ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/planck.gif] {planck} is Planck's constant and k B is Boltzmann's constant. A specific bound has been proposed on the basis of string theory where, for a large class of theories, one can show that Î·/ s â‰¥ ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/planck.gif] {planck} /(4Ï€ k B ). We will refer to a fluid that saturates the string theory bound as a perfect fluid. In this review we summarize theoretical and experimental information on the properties of the three main classes of quantum fluids that are known to have values of Î·/ s that are smaller than ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/planck.gif] {planck} / k B . These fluids are strongly coupled Bose fluids, in particular liquid helium, strongly correlated ultracold Fermi gases and the quark gluon plasma. We discuss the main theoretical approaches to transport properties of these fluids: kinetic theory, numerical simulations based on linear response theory and holographic dualities. We also summarize the experimental situation, in particular with regard to the observation of hydrodynamic behavior in ultracold Fermi gases and the quark gluon plasma.},

  Abstract                 = {Research with cold molecules has developed rapidly in recent years. There is now a variety of established methods for cooling molecules into the millikelvin range. Nevertheless, a focal point of current research is directed toward finding new ways to bring the temperature of molecules even closer to absolute zero. Samples of cold molecules offer not only important applications for high-resolution spectroscopy, which benefit from the increased interaction time of slow molecules with electromagnetic radiation; they also promise access to an exotic regime of chemical reactivity, in which phenomena such as quantum tunneling and quantum resonances predominate. This review begins with an introduction to the methods by which cold molecules can be prepared, with special emphasis on Stark deceleration and traps. In addition to applications of cold molecules that have already been partially achieved, an important focus of the review concentrates on possible future applications, and both aspects are illustrated with selected examples.},

The H + D2 (vibrational quantum number v = 0, rotational quantum number j = 0) reaction has been studied in crossed molecular beams at a collision energy of 1.28 electron volts, with the use of the technique of Rydberg atom time-of-flight spectroscopy. The experimental resolution achieved permits the determination of fully rovibrational state-resolved differential cross sections. The high-resolution data allow a detailed assessment of the applicability and quality of quasi-classical trajectory (QCT) and quantum mechanical (QM) calculations. The experimental results are in excellent agreement with the QM results and in slightly worse agreement with the QCT results. This theoretical reproduction of the experimental data was achieved without explicit consideration of geometric phase effects.},

  Abstract                 = {Clusters of atoms or molecules have been extensively studied by a variety of spectroscopies because of their unusual properties. Experiments with van der Waals clusters of defined sizes are not easily possible because nozzle beam expansions used in their production yield broad size distributions. Moreover, being weakly bound they readily fragment in the commonly used electron impact-ionization mass spectrometer detectors. Here it is shown that light fragile clusters of He, H2, and D2 can be selected and identified nondestructively by diffraction from a transmission grating. The method is universally applicable also to heavier species and well suited for spectroscopic studies.},

At high spin imbalances, the system does not become superfluid even at zero temperature. In this normal phase, full pairing of the minority atoms was observed. Hence, mismatched Fermi surfaces do not prevent pairing but can quench the superfluid state, thus realizing a system of fermion pairs that do not condense even at the lowest temperature.},

  Abstract                 = {Quantum defect theory (QDT) is concerned with the properties of an electron in the field of a positive ion and, in particular, with expressing those properties in terms of analytical functions of the energy. It provides a unified theory of bound states, including series perturbations, autoionisation and electron-ion scattering, both elastic and inelastic. The main emphasis of the review is on the foundations of the theory. Properties of Coulomb functions are discussed in some detail and outline sketches are given of relevant topics in collision theory and radiative theory. One-channel and many-channel QDT are discussed separately. Applications to the following problems are considered: resonances, atomic collision calculations, systems with two energy levels of the ion core, helium, other rare gases, alkaline earths and other atomic systems, molecular hydrogen, dielectronic recombination.},

  Abstract                 = { The experimental and theoretical study of molecular anions has undergone explosive growth over the past 40 years. Advances in techniques used to generate anions in appreciable numbers as well as new ion-storage, ion-optics, and laser spectroscopic tools have been key on the experimental front. Theoretical developments on the electronic structure and molecular dynamics fronts now allow one to achieve higher accuracy and to study electronically metastable states, thus bringing theory in close collaboration with experiment in this field. In this article, many of the experimental and theoretical challenges specific to studying molecular anions are discussed. Results from many research groups on several classes of molecular anions are overviewed, and both literature citations and active (in online html and pdf versions) links to numerous contributing scientists’ Web sites are provided. Specific focus is made on the following families of anions: dipole-bound, zwitterion-bound, double-Rydberg, multiply charged, metastable, cluster-based, and biological anions. In discussing each kind of anion, emphasis is placed on the structural, energetic, spectroscopic, and chemical-reactivity characteristics that make these anions novel, interesting, and important. },

  Abstract                 = {We present quantum-theoretical studies of collisions between an open-shell S-state atom and a 2[capital Pi]-state molecule in the presence of a magnetic field. We analyze the collisional Hamiltonian and discuss possible mechanisms for inelastic collisions in such systems. The theory is applied to the collisions of the nitrogen atom (4S) with the OH molecule{,} with both collision partners initially in fully spin-stretched (magnetically trappable) states{,} assuming that the interaction takes place exclusively on the two high-spin (quintet) potential energy surfaces. The surfaces for the quintet states are obtained from spin-unrestricted coupled-cluster calculations with single{,} double{,} and noniterative triple excitations. We find substantial inelasticity{,} arising from strong couplings due to the anisotropy of the interaction potential and the anisotropic spin-spin dipolar interaction. The mechanism involving the dipolar interaction dominates for small magnetic field strengths and ultralow collision energies{,} while the mechanism involving the potential anisotropy prevails when the field strength is larger (above 100 G) or the collision energy is higher (above 1 mK). The numerical results suggest that sympathetic cooling of magnetically trapped OH by collisions with ultracold N atoms will not be successful at higher temperatures.},

A sample of cold molecules, initially distributed over several vibrational levels, has thus been transfered into a single selected vibrational level of the singlet X 1 ÃŽÂ£ g ground electronic state. Our method is based on repeated optical pumping by laser light with a spectrum broad enough to excite all populated vibrational levels but limited in its frequency bandwidth with a spatial light modulator. In such a way we are able to eliminate transitions from the selected level, in which molecules accumulate. In this paper we briefly report the main experimental results and then address, in a detailed way by computer simulations, the perspectives for a Ã¢â‚¬Å“complete" cooling of the molecules, including also the rotational degree of freedom. Since the pumping process strongly depends on the relative shape of the ground and excited potential curves, ro-vibrational cooling through different excited states is theoretically compared.},

Starting from a sample of cold molecules produced in a collection of vibrational levels of the ground state, our method was based on repeated optical pumping by laser light with a spectrum broad enough to excite all populated vibrational levels but frequency-limited in such a way to eliminate transitions from v =0 level, in which molecules accumulate. In this paper, this method is generalized to accumulate molecules into an arbitrary selected 'target' vibrational level. It is implemented by using ultrashort pulse shaping techniques based on liquid crystal spatial light modulator. In particular, a large fraction of the initially present molecules is transferred into a selected vibrational level such as v =1, 2 and 7. Limitations of the method as well as the possible extension to rotational cooling are also discussed.},

  Abstract                 = { A review of our recent experiments on broadband vibrational cooling of cold cesium molecules and of the related theory is presented. Our method is based on repetitive optical pumping cycles driven by laser light which is broad enough to excite all populated vibrational levels. Originally, the accumulation of molecular population in a particular, pre-selected vibrational level was achieved by removing from the broadband light all frequencies that could excite that vibrational level and thus making it a Ã¢â‚¬Ëœdark stateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ of the system. Here, we focus onto an additional, more sophisticated shaping method, which consists of selecting only specific frequency components that excite molecules into vibrational levels that favourably decay into the pre-selected level. The population transfer to any desired state can thus be optimised, i.e. the total population transfer to the desired vibrational level is maximised while the number of absorptionÃ¢â‚¬â€œemission cycles required for the vibrational cooling is minimised. Finally, we apply this optimised technique to some more complex and still experimentally open cases: the pumping into the ground state for the case of Cs2 homonuclear molecules, the rotational pumping into a pre-selected ro-vibrational level and the NaCs as an example for heteronuclear molecules. },

  Abstract                 = {We discuss the strong-coupling regime of the nonlinear Landau-Zener problem occurring at coherent photo- and magneto-association of ultracold atoms. We apply a variational approach to an exact third-order nonlinear differential equation for the molecular state probability and construct an accurate approximation describing the time dynamics of the coupled atom-molecule system. The resultant solution improves the accuracy of the previous approximation [22]. The obtained results reveal a remarkable observation that in the strong-coupling limit, the resonance crossing is mostly governed by the nonlinearity, while the coherent atom-molecule oscillations occurring soon after crossing the resonance are principally of a linear nature. This observation is supposedly general for all nonlinear quantum systems having the same generic quadratic nonlinearity, due to the basic attributes of the resonance crossing processes in such systems. The constructed approximation turns out to have a larger applicability range than it was initially expected, covering the whole moderate-coupling regime for which the proposed solution accurately describes ail the main characteristics of the system evolution except the amplitude of the coherent atom-molecule oscillation, which is rather overestimated.},

  Abstract                 = {Aimed at obtaining complete and highly accurate potential energy surfaces for molecules containing heavy elements, we present a new general-order coupled cluster method which can be applied in the framework of the spin-free Dirac formalism. As an initial application we present a systematic study of electron correlation and relativistic effects on the spectroscopic and electric properties of the LiCs molecule in its electronic ground state. In particular, we closely investigate the importance of excitations higher than coupled cluster doubles, spin-free and spin-dependent relativistic effects and the correlation of outer-core electrons on the equilibrium bond length, the harmonic vibrational frequency, the dissociation energy, the dipole moment and the static electric dipole polarizability. We demonstrate that our new implementation allows for highly accurate calculations not only in the bonding region but also along the complete potential curve. The quality of our results is demonstrated by a vibrational analysis where an almost complete set of vibrational levels has been calculated accurately.},

From finite-field calculations we obtain an electric dipole moment for RbYb of almost 1 D. In combination with its magnetic dipole moment this makes RbYb an excellent candidate for trapping and for studying dipolar interaction in the ultracold regime. Significant FranckÃ¢Ë†â€™Condon factors are found between the rovibronic ground state and the lowest rovibrational levels of the first excited 2ÃŽÂ£1/2+ state but also between a broad range of rovibrational levels of the 2ÃŽÂ 1/2 and 2ÃŽÂ 3/2 states. This allows for several two-step approaches to reach the rovibronic ground state after initial photoassociation. },

  Abstract                 = {We investigate finite-range effects in systems with three identical bosons. We calculate recombination rates and bound state spectra using two different finite-range models that have been used recently to describe the physics of cold atomic gases near Feshbach resonances where the scattering length is large. The models are built on contact potentials which take into account finite-range effects; one is a two-channel model and the other is an effective range expansion model implemented through the boundary condition on the three-body wavefunction when two of the particles are at the same point in space. We compare the results with the results of the ubiquitous single-parameter zero-range model where only the scattering length is taken into account. Both finite-range models predict variations of the well-known geometric scaling factor 22.7 that arises in Efimov physics. The threshold value at negative scattering length for creation of a bound trimer moves to higher or lower values depending on the sign of the effective range compared to the location of the threshold for the single-parameter zero-range model. Large effective ranges, corresponding to narrow resonances, are needed for the reduction to have any noticeable effect.},

  Abstract                 = {This article provides a review of recent work in the field of helium nanodroplet spectroscopy with an emphasis on the dynamical aspects of the interactions between molecules in helium as well as their interaction with this unique quantum solvent. Emphasis is placed on experimental methods and studies introducing recent new approaches, in particular including time-resolved techniques. Corresponding theoretical results on the energetics and dynamics of helium droplets are also discussed.},

In particular, in contrast to photoassociative spectra at thermal energies, which are broad and of low information content, photoassociative spectra of ultracold atoms are high resolution, permitting observation of small vibrational and rotational spacings of long-range molecular levels near dissociation (typically with outer classical turning points &gt;20 Ãƒâ€¦). The types of detection and theoretical analysis employed are illustrated, primarily using the example of39K2. Future directions and applications of this field (e.g., to ultracold molecular formation) are also discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Promising pathways for photoassociative formation of ultracold heteronuclear alkali metal dimers in their lowest rovibronic levels (denoted X(0,0)) are examined using high-quality ab initio calculations of potential energy curves currently available. A promising pathway for KRb, involving the resonant coupling of the 21ÃŽÂ  and 11ÃŽÂ  states just below the lowest excited asymptote (K(4s) + Rb(5p1/2)), is found to occur also for RbCs and less promisingly for KCs also. The resonant coupling of the 31ÃŽÂ£+ and 11ÃŽÂ  states, also just below the lowest excited asymptote, is found to be promising for LiNa, LiK, and LiRb and less promising for LiCs and KCs. Direct photoassociation to the 11ÃŽÂ  state near dissociation appears promising in the final dimers NaK, NaRb, and NaCs, although detuning more than 100 cmÃ¢Ë†â€™1 below the lowest excited asymptote may be required.},

  Abstract                 = {Optical lattice clocks with extremely stable frequency are possible when many atoms are interrogated simultaneously, but this precision may come at the cost of systematic inaccuracy resulting from atomic interactions. Density-dependent frequency shifts can occur even in a clock that uses fermionic atoms if they are subject to inhomogeneous optical excitation. However, sufficiently strong interactions can suppress collisional shifts in lattice sites containing more than one atom. We demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach with a strontium lattice clock by reducing both the collisional frequency shift and its uncertainty to the level of 10âˆ’17. This result eliminates the compromise between precision and accuracy in a many-particle system; both will continue to improve as the number of particles increases.},

The data are used to improve the collisional model for the Boseâ€“Bose mixture 41 K 87 Rb, one of the most promising candidates to create a molecular dipolar BEC.},

  Abstract                 = {We demonstrate the possibility of existence of meta-stable N -body Efimov states in trapped Bose systems with large scattering length. We calculate spectra of trapped systems of N =3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 bosons using a stochastic variational method with a restricted correlated Gaussian basis. For each system the calculations reveal a series of Efimov states where the energy and the r.m.s. radius exhibit the characteristic exponential dependence upon the state number. We also estimate the contribution of these states to the recombination rate of Bose-Einstein condensates.},

In the three-body system, these properties include the existence of a geometric spectrum of three-body Efimov states and a discrete scaling symmetry. Similar universal properties appear in 4-body and possibly higher-body systems as well. We set up an effective theory for few-body systems in a harmonic trap and study the modification of universal physics for 3- and 4-particle systems in external confinement. In particular, we focus on systems where the Efimov effect can occur and investigate the dependence of the 4-body spectrum on the experimental tuning parameters. },

All the excited state potential energy curves were computed using the equation of motion approach within the coupled-cluster singles and doubles framework and large basis-sets{,} while the ground state potential was computed using the coupled cluster method with single{,} double{,} and noniterative triple excitations. The leading long-range coefficients describing the dispersion interactions at large interatomic distances are also reported. The electric transition dipole moments have been obtained as the first residue of the polarization propagator computed with the linear response coupled-cluster method restricted to single and double excitations. Spin-orbit coupling matrix elements have been evaluated using the multireference configuration interaction method restricted to single and double excitations with a large active space. The electronic structure data were employed to investigate the possibility of forming deeply bound ultracold SrYb molecules in an optical lattice in a photoassociation experiment using continuous-wave lasers. Photoassociation near the intercombination line transition of atomic strontium into the vibrational levels of the strongly spin-orbit mixed b3[capital Sigma]+{,} a3[capital Pi]{,} A1[capital Pi]{,} and C1[capital Pi] states with subsequent efficient stabilization into the v[prime or minute][prime or minute] = 1 vibrational level of the electronic ground state is proposed. Ground state SrYb molecules can be accumulated by making use of collisional decay from v[prime or minute][prime or minute] = 1 to v[prime or minute][prime or minute] = 0.

  Abstract                 = {This tutorial is a theoretical work, in which we study the physics of ultra-cold dipolar bosonic gases in optical lattices. Such gases consist of bosonic atoms or molecules that interact via dipolar forces, and that are cooled below the quantum degeneracy temperature, typically in the nK range. When such a degenerate quantum gas is loaded into an optical lattice produced by standing waves of laser light, new kinds of physical phenomena occur. Then, these systems realize extended Hubbard-type models, and can be brought to a strongly correlated regime. The physical properties of such gases, dominated by the long-range, anisotropic dipoleâ€“dipole interactions, are discussed using the mean-field approximations and exact quantum Monte Carlo techniques (the worm algorithm).},

  Abstract                 = {We study the interspecies scattering properties of ultracold Li–Cs mixtures in their two energetically lowest spin channels in the magnetic field range between 800 and 1000 G. Close to two broad Feshbach resonances (FR) we create weakly bound LiCs dimers by radio-frequency association and measure the dependence of their binding energy on the external magnetic field strength. Based on the binding energies and complementary atom loss spectroscopy of three other Li–Cs s -wave FRs we construct precise molecular singlet and triplet electronic ground state potentials using a coupled-channels calculation. We extract the Li–Cs interspecies scattering length as a function of the external field and obtain almost a ten-fold improvement in the precision of the values for the pole positions and widths of the s -wave FRs as compared to our previous work (Pires et al 2014 Phys. Rev. Lett. 112 [http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.112.250404] 250404 ). We discuss implications on the Efimov scenario and the universal geometric scaling for LiCsCs trimers.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper investigates the formation of cold molecules in the photoassociation of two cold atoms by a strong laser pulse applied at short interatomic distances, which lead to molecular dynamics taking place in the light-induced (adiabatic) potentials. A two-electronic-state model in the caesium dimer is used to analyse the effects of this strong coupling regime and to show specific results: (i) acceleration of the ground-state population to the inner zone due to a non-impulsive regime of coupling at short and intermediate interatomic distances, (ii) formation of cold molecules in strongly bound levels of the ground state, where the population at the end of the pulse is much bigger than the population photoassociated in bound levels of the excited state, and (iii) the final momentum distribution of the ground-state wavepacket keeping the signatures of the maxima in the initial wavefunction continuum. It is shown that the topology of the light-induced potentials plays an important role in dynamics.},

  Abstract                 = {By using broadband lasers{,} we demonstrate the possibilities for control of cold molecules formed via photoassociation. Firstly{,} we present a detection REMPI scheme (M. Viteau et al.{,} Phys. Rev. A{,} 2009{,} 79{,} 021402) to systematically investigate the mechanisms of formation of ultracold Cs2 molecules in deeply bound levels of their electronic ground state X1[capital Sigma]g+. This broadband detection scheme could be generalized to other molecular species. Then we report a vibrational cooling technique (M. Viteau et al.{,} Science{,} 2008{,} 321{,} 232) through optical pumping obtained by using a shaped mode locked femtosecond laser. The broadband femtosecond laser excites the molecules electronically{,} leading to a redistribution of the vibrational population in the ground state via a few absorption-spontaneous emission cycles. By removing the laser frequencies corresponding to the excitation of the v = 0 level{,} we realize a dark state for the so-shaped femtosecond laser{,} leading{,} with the successive laser pulses{,} to an accumulation of the molecules in the v = 0 level{,} i.e. a laser cooling of the vibration. The simulation of the vibrational laser cooling allows us to characterize the criteria to extend the mechanism to other molecular species (R. V. Krems{,} Int. Rev. Phys. Chem.{,} 2005{,} 24{,} 99). We finally discuss the generalization of the technique to laser cooling of the rotation of the molecule.},

  Abstract                 = {Helium shows fascinating quantum phenomena unseen in any other element. In its liquid phase, it is the only known superfluid. The smallest aggregates of helium, the dimer (He2) and the trimer (He3) are, in their predicted structure, unique natural quantum objects. While one might intuitively expect the structure of 4He3 to be an equilateral triangle, a manifold of predictions on its shape have yielded an ongoing dispute for more than 20 years. These predictions range from 4He3 being mainly linear to being mainly an equilateral triangle. Here we show experimental images of the wave functions of 4He3 and 3He4He2 obtained by Coulomb explosion imaging of mass-selected clusters. We propose that 4He3 is a structureless random cloud and that 3He4He2 exists as a quantum halo state.},

  Abstract                 = {The study of quantum mechanical bound states is as old as quantum theory itself. Yet, it took many years to realize that three-body Borromean systems that are bound when any two-body subsystem is unbound are abundant in nature. Here we demonstrate the existence of Borromean systems of spin-polarized (spinless) identical fermions in two spatial dimensions. The ground state with zero orbital (planar) angular momentum exists in a Borromean window between critical two- and three-body strengths. The doubly degenerate first excited states of angular momentum one appears only very close to the two-body threshold. They are the lowest in a possible sequence of so-called super-Efimov states. While the observation of the super-Efimov scaling could be very difficult, the Borromean ground state should be observable in cold atomic gases and could be the basis for producing a quantum gas of three-body states in two dimensions.},

  Abstract                 = {We have studied resonance-enhanced two-photon ionization of ultracold 39 K 85 Rb molecules in highly excited long-range vibrational levels of the X 1 ÃŽÂ£ + and a 3 ÃŽÂ£ + states. These molecules are formed by photoassociation (PA) of ultracold 39 K and 85 Rb atoms, followed by spontaneous emission to the X 1 ÃŽÂ£ + and a 3 ÃŽÂ£ + states. In the range 15 500Ã¢â‚¬â€œ17 200 cm Ã¢Ë†â€™1 , we observe many intermediate and long-range levels of the previously unobserved 4 3 ÃŽÂ£ + and 4 1 ÃŽÂ£ + states and evidence for the onset of the previously unobserved 3 3 ÃŽÂ  state. The observed vibrational spectra of these states are in very good agreement with calculated vibrational levels based on the ab initio potentials of Rousseau, Allouche and Aubert-FrÃƒÂ©con. Such experiments illustrate some of the unique advantages of using PA-produced ultracold molecules for investigation of long-range vibrational levels and long-range forces, and for unravelling dense spectra because only a few rotational levels are populated.},

  Abstract                 = {We find that universal three-body physics extends beyond the threshold regime to non-zero energies. For ultracold atomic gases with a negative two-body s-wave scattering length near a Feshbach resonance, we show that the resonant peaks characteristic of Efimov physics persist in three-body recombination to higher collision energies. For this and other inelastic processes, we use the adiabatic hyperspherical representation to derive universal analytical expressions for their dependence on the scattering length, the collision energy and—for narrow resonances—the effective range. These expressions are supported by full numerical solutions of the Schrödinger equation and display log-periodic dependence on energy characteristic of Efimov physics. This dependence is robust and might be used to experimentally observe several Efimov features.},

  Abstract                 = { Abstract: Conventional Raman techniques require a continuous-wave laser with stabilized wavelength, narrow line width, and sufficient output power. Due to their miniature size and low cost, diode lasers are good choice as light sources for Raman spectroscopy, especially when compact and portable instruments are needed. However, a solitary multimode diode laser has certain drawbacks that limit its use for Raman application. To circumvent these drawbacks, an external cavity can be coupled to the active gain medium of the diode to enhance the laser performance. A grating-based external cavity allows the laser to operate in a single longitudinal mode with greatly reduced line width and stabilized wavelength. This article examines the fundamentals of semiconductor lasers to show the necessity of operating diode lasers in an external cavity for Raman applications. Two feedback grating-based external cavity diode laser (ECDL) designs, viz. Littrow and Littman-Metcalf configurations, are explained. Historic and recent progress in the development of ECDL devices is reported. An updated summary of ECDL-equipped Raman systems applied to fields such as in vivo biomedical studies and in situ process/quality control is provided. Topics on mode-hop-free continuous scanning, wavelength stabilization, and dealing with ambient conditions are discussed. },

  Abstract                 = {Experimental studies with cold atoms have advanced our understanding of three-body physics, historically a fundamental yet challenging problem. This is because atomic interactions can be precisely varied in strength using magnetically tunable scattering resonances known as Feshbach resonances. Collisions near the unitarity limit, where scattering is maximum, are known to have universal aspects that are independent of short-range chemical details. Away from this limit, many quantum states are expected to be active during a three-body collision, making the collisional observables practically unpredictable. Here we predict three-body ultracold scattering rates by properly building in the pairwise van der Waals interactions plus the multi-spin properties of a tunable Feshbach resonance state characterized by known dimensionless two-body parameters. Numerically solving the Schrodinger equation then quantitatively determines three-atom collisional properties at all interaction strengths without needing adjustable parameters to fit data. Consequently, we can define a new class of van der Waals universality for cold atom three-body phenomena.},

  Abstract                 = {We investigate the interaction of femtosecond laser pulses with an ensemble of ultracold rubidium atoms by applying shaped excitation pulses with two different types of spectral filtering. Although the pulses, which are frequency filtered with a high pass, have no spectral overlap with molecular states, we observe coherent molecular transients. Similar transients obtained with nearly transform-limited pulses, where only the atomic resonance is removed, reveal two differing oscillatory components. The resulting transients are compared among themselves and supported with quantum dynamical simulations which indicate a photoassociation process. The effect is due to the strong field interaction of the pulse with the colliding atom pair.},

  Abstract                 = {Knowing when a physical system has reached sufficient size for its macroscopic properties to be well described by many-body theory is difficult. We investigated the crossover from few- to many-body physics by studying quasi–one-dimensional systems of ultracold atoms consisting of a single impurity interacting with an increasing number of identical fermions. We measured the interaction energy of such a system as a function of the number of majority atoms for different strengths of the interparticle interaction. As we increased the number of majority atoms one by one, we observed fast convergence of the normalized interaction energy toward a many-body limit calculated for a single impurity immersed in a Fermi sea of majority particles.},

Four sets of electrodes were used, each set having a different surface finish. The prebreakdown currents are found to be consistent with the Fowler-Nordheim field emission theory. The effects of the electrode surface finish on the field enhancement factor, the enhanced breakdown field, and on the current, current density and emitting area at breakdown are shown. The nature of the cathode microgeometry is deduced from the measurements of electron emission, and the change in the microgeometry with continued sparking is discussed.},

Our predictions show qualitative agreement with the data from Hodby et al (2005 Phys. Rev. Lett. 94 120402) without the use of adjustable parameters.},

  Abstract                 = {The heteronuclear atomic collision in the presence of a radio frequency (RF) electric field and a dc magnetic field is investigated theoretically by using the asymptotic bound state model. A RF field can be used to modify Feshbach resonance by choosing suitable intensity and frequency. The control mechanism is based on the interaction of the RF electric field with the instantaneous dipole moment of the collision atomic pair. We find an interesting phenomenon: the character exchange of the Feshbach resonances and resonance interference modulated by the RF field takes place in the ultracold collision of 6 Li and 40 K. This resonance interference may be used to modify the interactions in ultracold quantum gases.},

To suppress the heating by probe light with the 1 S 0 – 1 P 1 transition of the wavelength λ = 399 nm for high-resolution imaging and preserve atoms at the same lattice sites during the fluorescence imaging, we simultaneously cool atoms by additionally applying narrow-line optical molasses with the 1 S 0 – 3 P 1 transition of the wavelength λ = 556 nm. We achieve a low temperature of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1367-2630/18/2/023016/njpaa11d1ieqn2.gif] {$T=7.4(13)\ \mu {\rm{K}}$} , corresponding to a mean oscillation quantum number along the horizontal axes of 0.22(4) during the imaging process. We detect, on average, 200 fluorescence photons from a single atom within a 400 ms exposure time, and estimate a detection fidelity of 87(2)%. The realization of a quantum gas microscope with enough fidelity for Yb atoms in a Hubbard-regime optical lattice opens up the possibilities for studying various kinds of quantum many-body systems such as Bose and Fermi gases, and their mixtures, and also long-range-interacting systems such as Rydberg states.},

It is shown that due to temporal constructive quantum interference and the subsequent coherent accumulation, complete population transfer can be achieved by a few pulse pairs with suitable interpair and intrapair time delays even if a single pair of pulses in the train is so weak that nearly no population transfer can take place. The method is efficient and robust to moderate variations in the interpair and intrapair time delays, number of pulse pairs, and laser intensity, which is particularly favorable to coherent population transfer in quantum systems with weak oscillator strengths. },

  Abstract                 = {Experiments show how product pathways can be controlled by irradiation with one or more laser beams during individual bimolecular collisions or during unimolecular decompositions. For bimolecular collisions, control has been achieved by selective excitation of reagent vibrational modes, by control of reagent approach geometry, and by control of orbital alignment. For unimolecular reactions, control has been achieved by quantum interference between different reaction pathways connecting the same initial and final states and by adjusting the temporal shape and spectral content of ultrashort, chirped pulses of radiation. These collision-control experiments deeply enrich the understanding of how chemical reactions occur.},

Following the decay of these excited RbCs* molecules, the formed ground state molecules are directly ionized by a two-photon single-color pulse dye laser, which is a new ionization mechanism for ground state RbCs molecules and thence detected by time-of-flight mass spectroscopy.},

  Abstract                 = {The nuclei 6He and 11Li which exhibit pronounced halo-structures with two loosely bound valence neutrons, are currently being explored as secondary-beam projectiles. These nuclei are Borromean, i.e. while they are bound (only one bound state) they have, considered as three-body systems, no bound states in the binary subsystems. We argue that a three-body description is the natural one for central properties of such exotic loosely bound nuclei, and give the state of the art by comparing fully blown three-body calculations for 6He (and neighboring A=6 nuclei) with a range of measured observables. We restrict this review to bound state properties, with emphasis on genuine three-body features. The bound state is the initial stage of the various reaction scenarios that now are being studied experimentally and a main objective of these studies. Currently used procedures for solving the three-body bound state problem are outlined, with emphasis on expansions on hyperspherical harmonics and also the coordinate space Faddeev approach. Although strict calculations can also be carried out for 11Li, they are inconclusive concerning the details of the structure since the available information on the binary neutron-9Li(core) channel is insufficient. Calculations for a number of plausible model interactions, including treatments of the Pauli principle, are presented. They all reproduce the binding energy and halo characteristics such as valence one-particle density and give about the same internal r.m.s. geometry for 11Li. In spite of this, the wave functions have pronounced differences in their spatial correlations. The same ambiguity is also present in other inclusive observables, such as momentum distributions. We also demonstrate that candidates for the nuclear structure can be explored within an approximate scheme COSMA. Predictions of exclusive observables are discussed, and quantities such as momentum correlations in complete measurements are found to be more sensitive to the detailed features of the nuclear structure of the bound state. },

  Abstract                 = {The experimental revolution in ultracold atomic gas physics over the past decades has brought tremendous amounts of new insight to the world of degenerate quantum systems. Here we compare and contrast the developments of cold atomic gases with the physics of nuclei since many concepts, techniques, and nomenclatures are common to both fields. However, nuclei are finite systems with interactions that are typically much more complicated than those of ultracold atomic gases. The similarities and differences must therefore be carefully addressed for a meaningful comparison and to facilitate fruitful crossdisciplinary activity. We first consider condensates of bosonic and paired systems of fermionic particles with the mean-field description, but take great care to point out potential problems in the limit of small particle numbers. Along the way we review some of the basic results of Bose–Einstein condensate (BEC) and Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer (BCS) theory, as well as the BCS–BEC crossover and the Fermi gas in the unitarity limit, all within the context of ultracold atoms. Subsequently, we consider the specific example of an atomic Fermi gas from a nuclear physics perspective, comparing degrees of freedom, interactions, and relevant length and energy scales of cold atoms and nuclei. Next we address some attempts in nuclear physics to transfer the concepts of condensates in nuclei that can in principle be built from bosonic alpha-particle constituents. We also consider Efimov physics, a prime example of nuclear physics transferred to cold atoms, and consider which systems are more likely to show interesting bound state spectra. Finally, we address some recent studies of the BCS–BEC crossover in light nuclei and compare them to the concepts used in ultracold atomic gases. While many-body concepts such as BEC or BCS states are applicable in both subfields, we find that the interactions and finite particle numbers in nuclei can obscure the clear meaning they have in cold atoms. On the other hand, universal results from atomic physics should have an impact on certain limits of the nuclear domain. In particular, with advances in the trapping of few-body atomic systems we expect a more direct exchange of ideas and results.},

  Abstract                 = {We consider the problem of two heavy impurity particles embedded in a gas of weakly interacting light mass bosonic particles in the condensed state. Using the Bogoliubov approach to describe the bosonic gas and the Born-Oppenheimer approximation for the three-body dynamics, we calculate the modification to the heavy-heavy two-body potential due to the presence of the condensate. For the case of resonant interaction between the light bosons and the impurities, we present (semi)-analytical results for the potential in the limit of a large condensate coherence length. In particular, we find a formula for the modification of the Efimov scaling factor due to the presence of a degenerate bosonic gas background.},

  Abstract                 = {We established superfluidity in a two-state mixture of ultracold fermionic atoms with imbalanced state populations. This study relates to the long-standing debate about the nature of the superfluid state in Fermi systems. Indicators for superfluidity were condensates of fermion pairs and vortices in rotating clouds. For strong interactions, near a Feshbach resonance, superfluidity was observed for a broad range of population imbalances. We mapped out the superfluid regime as a function of interaction strength and population imbalance and characterized the quantum phase transition to the normal state, known as the Pauli limit of superfluidity.},
