\chapter{Conclusion and outlook}

Using the new setup, it is now possible to take images with low noise even at few atom numbers. With the high quantum efficiency, atoms are detected in more detail than before. The water cooling helps to cool the chip of the camera uniformly to allow minimal dark noise, which then separates the signal from the atoms from the background even at low atom numbers. Using the fast kinetics mode, the next step would be to take images of Lithium and Caesium consecutively. Previously, images of both species had to be taken from different clouds or axes.

The polarized Fermi gas already shows the potential of the new system. Building on that, one could now as well create a Fermionic superfluid from Lithium, using a spin imbalance. This new aggregate has a unique structure, where there is an unpolarized core surrounded by the majority spin component\todo{cite some superfluid paper}. The latter is then as well described by the same formulas as the polarized Fermi gas, which was also discussed in this thesis.
