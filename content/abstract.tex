\paragraph{Abstract}

This work describes the characterization and implementation of a new camera system for imaging of atomic density distributions in a multispecies ultracold atom experiment. The high quantum efficiency of the camera and its new readout mode, which allows for faster acquisition, are perfectly suited for scientific imaging. In this work, the noise sources that are induced from the camera itself, being the readout and dark noise, are described. To understand these, the setup of a typical CCD-camera is explained. At last, the imaging setup, including the magnification of an atomic cloud was tested on an ideal Fermi gas. The high resolution of the system and the noise reduction shows a precise distribution, which is explained and the degeneracy parameter is then extracted to be around $T/T_F=$ \todo{temperature...}.
